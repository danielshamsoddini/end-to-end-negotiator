<input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi there . i'd like 3 packages of food , and 2 packages of firewood . you can have 1 package of firewood and then all of the water . <eos> YOU: hi there ! hm . i was actually thinking that the food and firewood would be more useful to me than the water . <eos> THEM: i see . can you please explain why ? <eos> YOU: the group i'm camping with is having a fireside gathering in the evening , and i wanted to bring some food to share ( doesn't food always taste best outside ? ) and also some firewood to contribute . is there a particular reason you also wanted the food and firewood more ? <eos> THEM: that's understandable . i'm camping with a group of eight people for a whole week so i want to ensure that we have enough food for everyone . if we have enough firewood , we can cook enough meals to keep everyone fed <eos> YOU: great minds think alike ! here's a thought: my group is also doing some hiking during the day , and of course , since it's summer , we want to make sure we have enough water . so i could definitely see splitting this in a " some of each " way for all three items . <eos> THEM: yes , that sounds great to me . how about we each take two packages of food , firewood , and water to start . then , you can either take an extra package of food and i will take the extra firewood and water ? <eos> YOU: you say " each take two " of each of the three items . . . i think you must have meant " each take one " ? ( there's a total of three of each item . ) if so , for the extra , i think " food + wood " goes together better . how about one of us takes the extra water , and the other takes the extra food & wood ? <eos> THEM: yes , my mistake . i mean you take 1 food package , 1 firewood package , and 1 water package , and then i will do the same . then , you can take the food and wood and i will take the extra package of water ! <eos> YOU: that works beautifully ! i hope you'll have a wonderful camping trip . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , how are you doing ? <eos> THEM: not too good . i was robbed earlier before my camping trip with my boy . i need more items so i can take him on a camping trip that i've promised him for almost 6 months now . <eos> YOU: oh that is a shame . i am currently training for a marathon in greenland and i am trying to maintain my weight during this trip . what did they steal from you ? <eos> THEM: well after leaving the grocery , i put my groceries in my car and then got into the driver's seat . when i sat down , a man pointed his gun at me and told me to put my wallet in the center console and then get out the car . he took my car , wallet and all of my groceries . there were 3 packages of water , 3 bundles of firewood and 3 packages of food . <eos> YOU: i hope they catch that guy , well since you are close to our campsite we could cook something together . my husband brought his bow and fishing rod so i think we plan on getting some more food that way . <eos> THEM: that would be really nice of you , but my son is grown . he has a hearty appetite . i really need to feed him his snacks because he is austic and throws tantrums if he doesn't eat particular foods . same goes with water . <eos> YOU: i understand , our nephew has autism as well but not much of an appetite . we could also let you borrow the fishing rod and go out with your son for some bonding time . if you catch a fish or two that could help the trade on how much food i would be willing to give up . i am horribly afraid of darkness , so i would like more than enough firewood . <eos> THEM: if you could provide us with the food , it would be greatly appreciated . i recently lost my job so i was trying to take my boy on a trip to also get my mind off of things . i won't eat throughout the week if you can provide 2 fish ; however , if you did have a spare and could make it three , that would be greatly appreciated . one thing about the robbery that makes me really upset is that this guy took our firewood . i walked home after calling the police and was able to stop by a local park . there was some sticks i gathered to bring with us , but it won't last . any chance you can spare a few bundles ? <eos> YOU: hmmm , we picked up the firewood when we arrived the campsite because the park rangers do not want people bringing invasive pests to the area . i am horribly terrified of the dark and we are taking this trip for my husbands birthday . if it gets too dark i will not be able to sleep and it will not be good for my mental preparation for my marathon i have at the end of the month . i would really prefer to hand out more food than firewood since my husband is an amazing fisherman and i also enjoy eating squirrel . <eos> THEM: well how about this , i won't bother you about the firewood . i know it is something that seems beneficial to your well being . i can totally relate to that . for me , i would honestly rather any food you can spare , but my concern is water . it being the summer and a drought now , i don't think we'll make it through the weekend without any water . i can't afford any . do you think you can possibly provide us with 3 fish and 3 packages of water ? <eos> YOU: ok , i can give you two packages of food and two waters , we should be okay boiling our water . since my husband will be hunting for the extra food we will clean it and cook it , so can you give 2 packages of firewood ? <eos> THEM: i have no firewood . i have nothing ! i was robbed . if you want 1 package of firewood , i can give you 1 . however , i am going to need more food and water . i have sjorgren's syndrome . it causes me to dry out . my eyes , throat and really my full body gets dried up . its caused me to convulse in the past and have seizures . if something happens to me when i'm out in the words . who will take care of my boy ? i need to make sure i don't have an accident out there or they may take my son away from me . <eos> YOU: well we will be nearby . camping sounds a little dangerous with your condition . i suggest since you have no supplies to really offer that you stay next to our camp and share our fire . the ranger will give you the firewood upon arrival , if you give up the all 3 packages of firewood i will provide 2 food and 2 waters . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: i suggest we put excess in charge of working on proposition because prevention of excess is not a good first step . <eos> THEM: i don't know what you mean by " prevention of excess . " can you clarify ? <eos> YOU: what i mean by prevention of excess is that we should focus on getting excess and not to limit it regardless of what we already have because if we should offer some creative approaches by excess . we can both come to an agreement if you are interested . <eos> THEM: okay . lets just try to do some negotiation . i am the most interested in getting more water . the water i already have at the campsite looks dirty so , if it is okay with you , i would like all three of them . my food has also been stolen by bears and i don't make much left , so i would like two of the food items . you can have all the firewood and the other food item . how does that sound ? <eos> YOU: sound good enough but since you know i can not do without having anything to sustain me whenever i am thirsty then i suggest you are free to take two of the water and since your food has also been stolen by bears and you don't make much left , then you can have the two of the food items too and leave the three firewood for me with one food . how does that sound ? <eos> THEM: i think we are getting very close to a good deal . would you be willing to give me one firewood in case the stuff i have gets wet ? <eos> YOU: i strongly agree and shall we call it a deal now ? <eos> THEM: like i said , we are close but i really would feel better with just one of the firewood . i'm afraid of not being able to build a fire . if you really need the firewood , however , then i would take one additional item of either the water or food instead . <eos> YOU: and like i said , i strongly agree and you can have one firewood now . deal close ? <eos> THEM: yes . i think this is a fair deal . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi ! what are your preferences for the packages ? <eos> THEM: hello its good to speak with you today . my first priority is firewood , second is water . how about you ? <eos> YOU: same here so it looks like we're in the same boat . i would really like to take all 3 firewood , as i'm going to a high altitude . i would be willing to give you 2 waters though . does that work ? <eos> THEM: well if you take 3 firewood , give me 3 waters . we'll split the food since we have the same priority . <eos> YOU: that doesn't work for me . let's try to come to an agreement where we both get a bit of all three items . <eos> THEM: okay . why don't we each get two of everything and then split the rest . <eos> YOU: sorry i'm not sure i understand , since there are only three packages available of each item . do you mean we each get one firewood , one water , one food , and negotiate the rest afterwards ? <eos> THEM: no . we each get 2 firewood , 2 water and 2 food ( total of 6 ) . there would be 1 of each left ( total of 9 overall ) . we would split the remaining 3 - 1 water , 1 firewood and 1 food . <eos> YOU: but if we each get two firewood that means there are four available . am i missing something ? i didn't have any coffee this morning . <eos> THEM: i'm sorry you are correct . we would get 1 of each . <eos> YOU: ok no problem ! i was wonderinf if i was going crazy haha . ok so it sounds like we'll have to duke it out over the firewood . i'm going to a high altitude where there's not a lot of brush to collect , so that's why i want it . how about you ? <eos> THEM: you can have the remaining firewood and food if you give me the remaining water . <eos> YOU: that works for me ! thanks ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </input> <dialogue> THEM: can't wait to go on this trip . taking the whole family and my hyper active kids will probably need more water and food than what's provided . <eos> YOU: i see that you prefer the water and food . we are heading out to joshua tree for some hiking . we really need the extra water , and , there is no firewood to collect out there , so extra firewood would be very helpful for the cold , windy nights . <eos> THEM: water is my main concern . keeping the little ones hydrated is a full time job . i'm kind of concerned with how cold it might get at night . some extra firewood might be helpful . <eos> YOU: we have a good size group ; we are expecting 12 - 15 , and some of those are teenagers , so the water , food , and firewood will all be helpful for us too . i would like to take the waters and firewood . perhaps there are places for you to pick up some extra water , perhaps natural water sources ? out in the desert , we have no natural water sources to filter water or anything like that . <eos> THEM: i'm going to need 2 waters and at least 1 firewood . some food also . <eos> YOU: i see . i actually need at least two of the waters also . i can leave you two food , one firewood , and one water . i have a larger group than you , and i think my need is greater given that we are in desert conditions . given the need , i submit that this is a fair offer . <eos> THEM: group size isn't a concern since the basic supplies were enough for your trip . if you want 2 waters , i'm going to have to get 2 firewoods and 2 foods along with a water . <eos> YOU: group size is an issue . the 'enough' is only an estimate . a package of extra water will go much less further with 4 people than with 15 . your offer will not work for me . i ask you to reconsider my last offer . i am ready to finalize , but if we cannot come to agree , then we will both suffer . <eos> THEM: it's a give and take . we both want water the most . i gave in on that and agreed you could have 2 . now you'll have to compromise a bit and let me have 2 firewoods and 2 foods . it's only fair we both give in some . <eos> YOU: you might consider that fairness is not just about distribution , but about need . you haven't really convinced me that your need is as great as mine so that you should get the the greater of extra supplies . my final offer is twofold: to take 2 water and 2 firewood and one food , or , two firewood and three water . if neither of those will work for you , or unless you have a better offer , then i will have to walk away . <eos>  </dialogue> <output> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 9 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: dear friend . i am going camping and am in need of provisions . i am weary , but we must come to an agreement . i am requesting 3 food , 2 water , and 2 firewood . i know this is a big request , but the need is great . would you be so kind as to accept this request ? <eos> THEM: hi , i'm afraid i am also in dire need of them as well . i am open to negotiating , but will need a much fairer split than 3 , 2 , 2 . i propose 2 food for myself , 3 firewood , and 1 water <eos> YOU: you say fair , but that strikes me as a rather uneven split . what is your # 1 need ? <eos> THEM: i need food the most , and you ? <eos> YOU: i too need food most . if you have 2 food , that would leave me with only one of my most needed resource . i could possibly make this work , but then i would need 3 water and 2 firewood . <eos> THEM: i think the fairest would be a 5 / 4 split as there are 9 resources . why don't you take 2 food and 2 water . i will take 1 food , 3 firewood , and 1 water ? <eos> YOU: yes , agree to the first point . what is your second most needed resource ? <eos> THEM: firewood . i assume yours is water . thus if you get 2 of each of your top 2 , i'll need 1 and 3 , with the tie break being 1 remaining of least desireable to make it fair <eos> YOU: i think we can make that work . if you agree , let's submit the deal . i need to go to the doctor soon to get a boil lanced . <eos> THEM: ok , sounds good . feel free to submit it <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: reject - deal <eos>  </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 9 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi , have you been camping before ? from prior experience , i know it's vital to have extra supplies for this trip . what are your thoughts ? <eos> THEM: hello ! i have camped before and am looking forward to our trip ! i really enjoy a good , hot cup of coffee and would like to be confident that we'll be able to have a roaring campfire with as much firewood as we can . what do you think we should be able to take with us ? <eos> YOU: i too love a hot cocoa or tea , so we'll definitely need water , firewood is next up , and food is obvious i think we can take as much as we are allowed . if you wanted , i could take all the food , we could split the water , and you could take all or most of the firewood ? <eos> THEM: i must admit that i prefer coffee over tea , but agree we need a lot of firewood to heat it up . i'm not sure we would be able to find enough dry material to burn , so would appreciate all of the firewood . thank you ! as for water - i would agree with splitting it if i could have 2 please ? <eos> YOU: am i to understand you want all of the firewood , and most of the water ? that doesn't quite work for me , i would agree to all of the food , 1 of the waters if i could get one of the firewood ? i will live without the extra cups of tea <eos> THEM: you are correct . i do propose that i take 3 firewood and 2 water . i you initially asked to take all of the food which i would be agreeable to , but because i would have to solely eat off of what i find . therefore i think i need extra water to cook / boil what i find . how am i supposed to stay hydrated while foraging , since i wouldn't have any food ? <eos> YOU: i think it would be pointless to have food and nothing to drink . we should try and reach an amicable agreement tho , and based on our preferences being so similar , a rational split would seem most fair and favorable for the both of us . how about i take 2 food , 1 water , and 1 firewood ? <eos> THEM: i think we are close to an agreement . thank you for discussing this so openly ! is your main objective to get at least 1 of each type of item ? <eos> YOU: yes it is , as i know one can't work without the other , especially out in the wilderness ! <eos> THEM: i agree that they are all important . to help us both - what if you take 1 of each item and i carry the heavier weight of 2 of each ? that way you reach your goal of 1 of each item and don't have so much to lug around ! that would allow you to enjoy your camping trip so much better . <eos> YOU: as generous as that sounds , i don't feel that deal is fair at all . my goal isn't one of each , but being a frequent camper , i know what i personally need to be out in the woods . i can also carry a good amount of weight , i'm a strong girl <eos> THEM: i think we can agree on wood: you get 1 , i get 2 . i think we can agree on food: you get 1 , i get 2 . let's call those items as agreed upon . we're down to negotiating on water i believe . i'd hate for us to lose a great deal over 1 bottle of water . : ( i really need 2 bottles of water please . <eos> YOU: i'd hate to leave the deal too , the best i can go for is 2 of the food , 1 of the water , and 1 of the firewood if you really need the water . i can't do anything on 1 of each , i want you to have your coffee , but i have to think about me too i can do 2 food , 1 water , 1 firewood . i believe that covered your preference of more water and firewood in your first request ? i thought you'd be happy with that compromise <eos> THEM: to confirm - you'll take 1 wood , 1 water , and 2 food ? i can agree to that . <eos> YOU: yes , and thank you for being so kind , a real gentleman <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hy thats my offer <eos> THEM: hi there . . i'm sorry , i didn't see your offer as it doesn't show it for 10 messages , i believe . so , here's the situation . . i think i can get by with less firewood as i'm a floridian and prefer it cooler anyway . . also the food is not a huge thing for me as we can catch / improvise around the campsite - but i'm definitely interested in as much water as possible . . both for cooking and cleaning purposes , as well as drinking , of course . <eos> YOU: okay so what do you suggest <eos> THEM: well , i recognize you're gonna need water too . . so i'd love to take 2 of them , giving you one and i'm totally ok with going 1 on the firewood and one on the food . . that way we all ensure we have enough . . you're making out a bit better in quantity that way but i think its best for both of us <eos> YOU: i botttle of water for a can of food and 2 firewoods <eos> THEM: yeah , sorry , that's not going to work out for me . i'm going to need at least 2 bottles of water , 1 food packet , and one firewood . . again , this does leave you with two each on the food and the firewood , which are both very important things for this camping trip ! <eos> YOU: but thats the only offer im willing to give <eos> THEM: well then unfortunately i think we're gonna have to walk away from this and neither of us gets anything we could both use . . that's unfortunate and i'm sorry to see it end in such a less than magnanimous fashion <eos> YOU: you need water and i need food so unless we do 1 food to 1water is tht okay <eos> THEM: i'll tell you what i'm willing to do . . i can't really budge on the water . . but . . i could do something where i take 2 water , and only one firewood , but two food . . does that work for you ? <eos> YOU: so if i were to give you water what would i get ? <eos> THEM: you'd be getting 1 water , 2 firewood , and 1 food <eos> YOU: how much food are you willing to offer for water <eos> THEM: we can go back to my original offer which was honestly more generous . . i get 2 water , 1 firewood , 1 food . . you get 1 water , 2 firewood , 2 food . . its honestly a better deal for you <eos> YOU: no its not i give you i water i get 1 food and 1 firewood <eos> THEM: we only have 3 of each to divide up . . so yes , you're going to have to give me one more on an item . . but in exchange i'm giving you 1 more on two different items . i'm getting 4 items in total , you're getting 5 . . - you're essentially netting 11 % more 'items' than i am in this deal . <eos> YOU: thats the point as you need water so badly <eos> THEM: correct . . i do . . but if you're not willing to budge on this where you're still netting more overall value i understand - i'm bummed but i understand . <eos> YOU: im contented with what i have but im willing to trade as yu need more water so i need t make a profit <eos> THEM: that's unfortunate then as instead of making a tiny bit less of a profit now you're not going to make any because you would rather give up the deal . also , if you do the math , you'll see that i'm actually benefiting you here - i understand , though . i can put through the offer and hope you change your mind so we both benefit . <eos> YOU: im fine with that <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello . i'm going to do a lot of hiking on my camping trip and need as much water as possible . i'm also planning a bonfire with fellow campers in the area , so i'd like as much firewood as possible . how about i keep the water and firewood and you keep the food ? <eos> THEM: that doesn't work for me . i will also need extra water because i drink a lot . how about we start by saying you get the firewood , and i'll take the food ? <eos> YOU: ok , but how do we split up the water ? because it sounds like we both need some . what if you take all the food and i take all the firewood and then i get two waters and you get one extra ? <eos> THEM: i would prefer to have 2 waters since i agreed to give you all the firewood . <eos> YOU: but i agreed to give you all the food . now that you want two waters , i think i should have some food because i left a bag of my food at home . you get two waters and i get one of the food . then you get the majority of both the water and food . <eos> THEM: so i get 2 waters / 2 food / 0 firewood , and you get 1 water / 1 food / 3 firewood ? i think that works for me . <eos> YOU: yes , that's the plan . by the way , what do you need all that food for ? you didn't say . i'm just curious . <eos> THEM: i'm a bigger guy ( 6'3 " ) so i eat a lot , especially after activities like hiking and kayaking . same reason i want water really . <eos> YOU: ok , that makes sense . i don't eat as much as you do , so it's only fair that you get most of the food . so i hope this deal will be fair for both of us and you'll walk away happy . <eos> THEM: yep , i'm happy , hope you are too ! i think we can enter the deal now . <eos> YOU: yes , i am . i'm entering the deal now . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: i would like to get 3 of the extra food packets and 1 firewood <eos> THEM: hello . how are you . that is a lot considering my issue that i have - i need to eat or at least snack something multiple times a day , otherwise i won't be able to function on this trip . i was hoping to get 3 food as well . not sure if i could do 2 . <eos> YOU: oh maybe we can work something out , i need the extra food packets as my children will be with me . even if i dont eat , i need for them to have plenty . could i get 2 food packets and 2 of the firewood packs ? <eos> THEM: i could possible consider 2 firewood packs if i get all 3 food ? <eos> YOU: i cant give up the 3 food packets , my kids will starve . the most i can do is give you 1 food packet , 1 firewood and 2 of the extra waters <eos> THEM: i might not be able to go to the trip then . i understand that we all do get basic packets already . unfortunately - as i said - i would be not able to function there properly . i understand your concern but i am sorry . <eos> YOU: well if we walk away we both suffer , lets try to think about all that is involved . unfortunately , we cant split the 3rd food packet . i think i should take the 2 food packets since children are involved . how can we split the rest of the items to make it fair . <eos> THEM: i cannot even think further about getting anything . i know i will suffer if i go without these supplies . so for me it would be not good one way or the other . plus firewood is another crucial thing because i get so cold and would need to constantly keep warm . so these two things both are crucial . <eos> YOU: how about this i will share 1 food packet with my kids . i would need 2 firewood packs , and the 3 extra waters . that way you can have the 2 food packets <eos> THEM: in that case you are getting way more supplies . this is why i was already saying earlier - one way or the other i would suffer because firewood is also so important . and if i am not getting more food - that is also not good , because water can help with food cravings . <eos> YOU: that deal would give you 2 food packets , and 1 extra firewood . that is a fair trade - off <eos> THEM: 3 - 6 ? i don't consider that fair , i am sorry . <eos> YOU: so you get 2 food packets , 1 firewood , and 1 water . it is very fair food is mych more valuable then the other items and was your deciding factoe to go or not to go , you will have more food than myself and 3 kids . it is very fair . <eos> THEM: i might be able to be ok with that - as i said - water could help deal with extra food cravings . <eos> YOU: yes , we would have less food but a little extra water to help with that . can we agree on me getting 1 food packet , 2 firewood packets , and 2 waters ? <eos> THEM: ok . <eos> YOU: that means you get 2 food , 1 firewood , and 1 water , correct ? <eos> THEM: ok <eos> YOU: alright i hope we both have a fun trip ! ! ! <eos> THEM: i hope so , as well . enjoy . i am sorry , i am just worried for my conditions . . . thank you . <eos> YOU: no worries ! ! ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi - i'm so excited for our camping trip . i'm most excited about getting to eat food that i normally don't when i am home . <eos> YOU: hello ! camper , how are you ? i need us to make a deal where we all benefit . <eos> THEM: i agree - i really love food . if i don't get it , i get hangry . if you're ok with me getting all the food , i think i can make it with just one firewood and one water . <eos> YOU: what do you think if in the camp we get together and hold a meeting between your family and mine . we can have a small party so that we get to know each other better . <eos> THEM: that sounds like an excellent idea . i love meeting and getting to know others . <eos> YOU: my main objective for the camp is also food , since i have a large family and the amount of food they give in the camp is very small for my whole family . <eos> THEM: i can do without one of the food , so maybe i can get 2 food , 2 firewood , and 1 water ? <eos> YOU: i do not like the deal very much , but for that we must talk and decide as adults a good deal for both of us . what we want is to enjoy in the camp . <eos> THEM: agreed - i enjoy camping . a big part of that for me is that i get to eat food . if i don't eat , i don't enjoy it so camping is basically a buffet for me . i am pretty dead set on having at least two packages of food . i can negotiate the water and firewood . <eos> YOU: how many members are there in your family group ? to make a proposal taking into account the food you need according to your family group . <eos> THEM: i have me , my wife , and my four kids . they are all teenagers . you know how they go through food . <eos> YOU: before making a deal i like to talk to people , to get to know them better . and if we are going to make a proposal for a party between the two families in the camp , it is in our best interest to know each other better . <eos> THEM: understood , but i don't know anything about you . i've offered a lot of information about me . this is a two - way street . <eos> YOU: my family is made up of my wife , my five children and me . all my children are minors , but they eat too much . when they don't eat they get very restless . <eos> THEM: i think one teenage kid is equivalent to young children . the least i'm willing to accept is 2 food , 2 firewood , and 1 water . i don't see another option as you haven't provided me any . let me know so we can get on our own camping trips . <eos> YOU: ok , my proposal is to give you everything you need for food , because you have given me good reasons , on the condition that you give me everything i need for water and firewood . because i can take some food to cook in the camp and i need a lot of firewood and water . <eos> THEM: what is your proposal . everything meaning you get 3 firewood and 3 water is not going to work for me . let me know . <eos> YOU: my proposal is to give you 2 foods , 1 water and 1 wood . i need water and firewood to cook in the camp . unless you want 2 for water , 2 for reading , and 1 for food ? <eos> THEM: no thanks - i don't think we're going to come to a deal . i hope you enjoy your camping trip . <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: reject - deal <eos> YOU: reject - deal <eos> YOU: i can offer you this other treatment: 3 food , 0 firewood and 1 water . i'm giving you all the food . what does it say ? <eos> THEM: i'm going to go ahead and walk away from this deal . i think it's not going to work for us so i wish you , your spouse , and five children a ton of fun on your camping trip . <eos>  </dialogue> <output> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi i really need the additional wood and food for health reasons . i have a long term issue with maintaining body temperature and have to keep my blood sugar levels up . <eos> THEM: that sounds rough . i'd be willing to work with you on a deal and making sure your blood sugar and body temperature don't get to dangerous levels . <eos> YOU: i appreciate that . how about i get one less food and an additional water . i really don't like the cold . <eos> THEM: i don't mind the cold too much . i'd really be appreciative if i could get extra water . i have a hard time in the mountains if i'm not hydrated fully . i'm from the flat plains and the elevation makes me sick if i'm not careful . <eos> YOU: i can handle less water but i really need the food and wood . i am willing to give you two waters but i don't think it would be a good idea to go without water . <eos> THEM: i wouldn't feel right sending you out without any water even though i would love all 3 . l can make do with 1 food and make sure you have enough to take care of your blood sugar . could you spare 1 wood possibly ? i'm rarely cold but if i run out of water i'll try boiling some to get by and building a fire without good wood won't be easy if i'm already getting dehydrated while camping . i hope you understand . <eos> YOU: would it work if i had two wood , two food , and one water ? i don't drink a lot . <eos> THEM: i think i can make that work for me . since this is important and we both have health worries make sure and think about it before we make an agreement . your priorities were food then wood , right ? i'd hate for us to make a hasty decision and regret it once were actually out there camping . <eos> YOU: i completely understand . it's not fun being out there in the wilderness and coming up short . our health is also of the utmost importance . nobody will have fun if we get sick . <eos> THEM: you needed wood and food most . i need water the most and the other two just to make sure i stay healthy . after double checking i think that that agreement works out perfectly . that would mean two waters , one food , and one wood for me then . <eos> YOU: thank you so much for understanding my health challenges . i will submit the deal . <eos> THEM: no worries . i appreciate you working with me on my needs as well . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi as a starting point i just put in an initial proposal <eos> YOU: i'm unable to see your proposal . i'm hoping to get at least 2 additional packages of firewood . i forgot my sleeping bag and blankets , so extra firewood would help me stay warm at night . <eos> THEM: i was hoping for two packages of firewood as well . . . i would need it to heat the food and water <eos> YOU: i would be willing to give you the 2 packages of firewood if i'm able to take all of the food and one water . my dog is coming on the camping trip and i'm worried with all the extra activity he won't have enough food and water packed for the weekend . <eos> THEM: i would need one food and one water in addition to the firewood . alternatively , you can have 2 firewoods if i could have 2 foods and 2 waters <eos> YOU: i would feel better about our trip if i was able to have 2 firewood 1 food and 2 waters . is that something you would be interested in doing ? i think i can make do on the food , but extra water for my pup would be ideal . <eos> THEM: so if you have the extra firewood you can boil water at the campsite for your dog . i am a dog lover as well and want to be sure they are taken care of . i propose we set up a ratio of 2to 1 for firewood and water ( if you get two firewood you get one water and vice versa ) that seems they only way for us both to have something that we can work with <eos> YOU: i appreciate that you're a fellow dog lover . i hadn't thought about boiling water . a 2:1 ratio seems fair to me . <eos> THEM: how about if the person who get the two firewood ( which seems to be the most desirable entity ) only gets 1 food and the person who gets the lesser valued water gets the extra food . that seems fair to me <eos> YOU: i can agree with that . the firewood is my biggest concern because i forgot the blankets ! as long as i'm warm , i should be able to make do on 1 food and 1 water . <eos> THEM: okay so i propose you get two firewood , one water and one food . i get one firewood , two food and two water . do you agree ? <eos> YOU: yes , i agree . i'll submit the deal now . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , i am a lifelong camper . my favorite part of camping is sitting by the fire at night . i propose 3 packages of firewood for me , 1 water and 1 food . <eos> THEM: camping's definitely something i enjoy a lot too , but i also love to cook and would want at least a little wood to make a nice meal . i'd also like to go hiking at least once while i'm out . what about 3 food , one wood , and one water for myself ? <eos> YOU: well i need at least 1 food for myself . i'm very active , too . i love to hike and i imagine i would be very hungry . i need to replenish those calories . <eos> THEM: well remember that we both have enough food already for our trip , so this would just be some extra . would it make you feel any better if i brought you some of the food i made ? <eos> YOU: in the era of social distancing , i would rather cook my own food , but that was very nice of you to offer . <eos> THEM: yeah , i definitely know what you mean there . it sounds like you're more active than me so i think we can definitely agree on you getting two of the water and me just getting one for now <eos> YOU: okay let's agree to me getting 2 water and you getting 1 water . as for the firewood , it is really important to me to get 3 . camping is my life . my parents took us camping all throughout my childhood . we loved sitting around the fire together at night and having a good time . my parents have since passed on and i really need the extra firewood to keep this tradition and memories alive . <eos> THEM: sorry for your loss . i can respect wanting to keep them in your thoughts with a roaring bonfire or three while you're out , but are you going alone ? i'm going with a group of four so there's going to be at least someone there that will also want a bigger fire one night even if i don't . <eos> YOU: i will have 3 people with me . my son , my sister and her daughter . so okay , how about i take 2 firewood , 2 water and 1 food ? <eos> THEM: i think that's pretty agreeable for covering our bases ; though if your kids are young i could see you not needing two extra containers of water since you're probably not going on any short hikes . the food and fire seems respectful to both of our needs <eos> YOU: my son is 15 and my niece is 13 . they are athletes . we will be doing hiking and biking . we will be needing the extra water . <eos> THEM: alright then ; we were focusing more on canoeing with a bit of hiking on the side so i suppose i'll cede you the extra water . if it sounds good to you i'll submit my deal of 2 food , 1 water , 1 firewood now . <eos> YOU: ok i think that is fair <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 9 3 6 </partner_input>
