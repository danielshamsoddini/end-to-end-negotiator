<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , i hope you are well . i was hoping to get some packages from you . how does 3 packages of firewood , 2 packages of food , and 2 packages of water sound ? <eos> THEM: that's a steep price . that you would give you 7 items and me only 4 . i think we can work something out if you're willing to compromise though . food is very important to me . if you are asking for 3 packages of firewood , i'd like 3 packages of food . <eos> YOU: i'm not sure about that offer . i do need food as well , but water is not my number one priority . would you be willing to give 3 packages of firewood , 1 package of food , and no water ? <eos> THEM: let me consider . i miscalculated on my first statement - your initial offer would leave me with only 2 ( ! ) items . but this is more reasonable . i assume you value water the least ? <eos> YOU: yes ! firewood is my top priority , along with food . what do you need most ? <eos> THEM: food is highest , and a critical resource of course . last time i went camping , some of it spoiled . firewood is least of my concerns since it's very hot where i live right now , so i'm willing to let you have all 3 of that . <eos> YOU: awesome ! firewood is much needed because it gets very cold at night here . <eos> THEM: but you still need some food . you're asking me to give 1 package of food , 3 firewood , but no water ? does that offer still stand ? <eos> YOU: yes , i think that will work in favor of us both . what do you think ? <eos> THEM: i think i can work with that . so , just to be sure we're on the same page , you will get 3 firewood , 1 food , 0 water . i will get 0 firewood , 2 food , 3 water . <eos> YOU: yes , that is the deal on the table . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 9 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi there ! i figured it might be best to start off with asking which packages you wanted extra of ? <eos> THEM: i need three packages of water and three food . i am going to a dry , hot location . we will be hiking a lot . <eos> YOU: ah , i see ! you definitely will need extra water then i also was hoping to get extra packages of food as well . <eos> THEM: are there any sources of food for you there where you are staying ? we are out in the wilderness and there are no convenience stores for 50 plus miles . plus we will be on the trail a lot . very primitive camping . <eos> YOU: i see , i think we're definitely in similar situations . i won't have much access to food either , and we have a lot of people going camping with us , so we wanted to make sure we prepared so everyone gets a fair share of food . <eos> THEM: okay . well , i can see we have a dilemma . since the temperatures will be warm , i wasn't planning on doing too many fires , but how about this ? i can take the three waters , you take 2 of the extra food , and i'll take 2 firewood ? <eos> YOU: you can definitely have the three waters ! as for the firewood , i did plan on having a fire for a majority of the night , so i'd definitely like extra wood ! i was actually going to ask if you would be willing to give me the 3 packages of firewood ? <eos> THEM: well , if i leave you 2 of the packages of food , then i need more firewood to trade for food , or , to cook fish that i catch . which do you need more , the wood or the food ? <eos> YOU: for sure , i completely understand . i definitely would need the food more than the water ! <eos> THEM: okay , thanks for the water . i can give you all of the wood . it would really help me to take two food packages . <eos> YOU: i misspoke in my last message , as i meant i would need the food more than the wood . but i'd be willing to give you the 3 water and 2 food ! i'll take the 3 wood and 1 food ? <eos> THEM: okay , sounds like a deal . . . are you ready to submit ? <eos> YOU: yes ! you can go ahead and submit your deal <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi ! i'm super excited to go camping with my family , especially since we haven't been able to get out of the house due to covid . are you going camping too ? <eos> YOU: yes i am ! i'm going camping way up north so it's going to be super super cold . is it okay if i take all the firewood ? <eos> THEM: super cold up north ? its august right now . are you going to be ok ? should you also take water and food ? <eos> YOU: even though it's august it can actually get pretty cold at night . currently it's 70 where i live and that's at noon when it's the warmest ! and no , i don't need as much water for example because my mom stockpiled it all during covid . <eos> THEM: so you plan to be sleeping outside instead of in a tent ? we're planning on doing a lot of fishing and we want to cook the fish we catch over a campfire every night . . . <eos> YOU: i'll definitely be sleeping inside . . . but my family loves sitting around the campfire late into the night . we normally don't sleep a lot when camping haha . how about i take 2 firewood , and you take 1 . i can offer you more food to make up for the fish tho ! <eos> THEM: mmmm . . . i dunno . . . i've packed food for " just in case " but we're really planning moreso to cook the fish we catch than pack more food . my husband wants to do this trail where we hike along the perimeter of the lake and set up camp every night <eos> YOU: could you then offer a deal ? i'm getting impatient and will leave soon . i'm thinking 2 firewood for me and 1 for you . and 2 food for you and 1 for me . if it makes you happy you can also have 2 water . <eos> THEM: sorry , i've got other things to do in addition to this negotiation . and i don't really have a grasp on how important these resources are you to you and why i should give in to your demands . <eos> YOU: well then offer a counterdeal ! i don't understand what you want me to do if you're not giving options lol <eos> THEM: <selection>YOU: reject - deal <eos> THEM: reject - deal <eos> THEM: i thought you wanted firewood so badly , that's why i proposed the previous deal . i originally wanted firewood but since you're being so rude , i figured i'd give in to your selfish demand and offer all of the firewood to you . <eos> YOU: i don't appreciate the rude tone . i thank you for that , but you're still getting more out of the deal than i am . if i could just have 1 additional water i would be satisfied ! and according to my calculations , you come out on the better side ! <eos> THEM: i know you don't appreciate it because its not what you want to hear . if i give you 1 water , it does not come out with me on the better side , i'm worse off . <eos>  </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </input> <dialogue> YOU: i would really like to have 3 waters and 3 firewood because this is my first time camping and i don't have survival skills . <eos> THEM: you must be a comedian . we will need to come to a compromise because there's no way that's going to happen . i am like a water buffalo so i'll need at least two waters . in addition , my family is from the south and will need firewood as well . <eos> YOU: i can't swim too . i think two waters will help me to survive on this trip and i will need at least two firewood to make fish or other food items for my family . <eos> THEM: you don't need this water to swim . you can take two of the food if you're worried about food . i will take two water and two firewood since i have a large family to nourish and keep warm . your initial suggestion of 3 waters and firewood is laughable . please provide a realistic compromise . <eos> YOU: if i take two waters , 1 firewood , and 2 food supplies , this will help me during the trip . it seems as if you are more skilled than i am on a camping trip . please consider my request <eos> THEM: lol - not a chance . you're going to have to give me more than that . i am more skilled and thus need firewood . how about this . . . i will take 3 firewood and 2 food . you can take all the water because you're so non - skilled in the wilderness . i am going to hunt for my food , but again i have a large family . i am not considering your request at all . we will need to come to a decision relatively soon . <eos> YOU: i understand your preferences . if i take all of the water , 1 firewood , and 2 food your family will still have the opportunity to have a good camping trip and i can learn to survive on this trip . please consider my request again . <eos> THEM: ok - you're not being reasonable at all . if you're so incompetent at going camping , maybe you should stay home and i can take all the supplies . how's that for an excellent offer ? all for me and 0 for you . <eos> YOU: i think it would be good to come to a compromise . if i take all of the water and have the 2 foods , you can take all of the firewood as you originally proposed . yet , i will have a tough time learning how to survive on a camping trip . <eos> THEM: again , that's not a fair compromise . . . . you get all of what we both we want and more of another item . let me state it to you clearly so you can understand . i will not accept that offer . there is no chance you are getting all the water now that i think about it . i will offer i get 1 water , 2 firewood , and 2 food . if you can't come up with a reasonable offer , i will just walk away and we both get nothing . i will survive because i will have skills . <eos> YOU: i think this is reasonable because you have a big family . i will accept 2 waters , 1 firewood , and 1 food . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello . what item did you need a little extra of ? <eos> THEM: thank you for asking , i would really like some extra fire wood as i usually get cold and scared at night so i can keep a fire going . <eos> YOU: i'd be willing to give you all my firewood if you could give me all the water . <eos> THEM: i do need at least one extra water bottle in case the fire goes out of control , but i am willing to forgo any food as i can forage for food . <eos> YOU: alright . thanks . i only ask for so much of the water because i am overweight and i know while camping i'll work up a huge sweat . <eos> THEM: great , that sounds good to me , are you okay with keeping all the food or would 3 be too much ? <eos> YOU: i'd be ok with keeping all the food . i do eat a bit too much and if for some reason i get lost it would be helpful to have ! <eos> THEM: i agree with that , so you would get the two water and three food and i would get one water and three firewood ? <eos> YOU: yeah . if that's alright with you ? it rained here recently but i bought a top of the line tent and sleeping bag so if i do run out of firewood i'll still be ok . <eos> THEM: yes , i'm glad we could come to an agreement , i will submit the deal now . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=3 item2=2 item0=3 item1=0 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello . great to see a fellow camper and hiker . i'm heer with my wife and mother - in - law . they are really looking forward to roasting marshmellows this evening after so serious hiking ! how are you doing ? <eos> YOU: hi ! i am bringing along a huge extended family with me , looking forward to tonight ! would you mind sharing your highest priority item so that we can try to come up with a fair way to distribute everything ? <eos> THEM: well i can share some food if you have alot of family coming over . we plan on raosting marshmellows and making s'more each night here in honor of my wife's dad who passed away last year . that was a big tradition with them and their camp outs . so we really need the firewood and extra water for the hikes which are pretty roughed . <eos> YOU: got it , makes sense . actually i need food the most since my family will be so hungry ! i would be totally okay with you getting all the extra firewood if i got all the food . then we would just need to discuss how to split up water ( since my family is going on a hike too , that would be awesome to have too ) <eos> THEM: ok . sounds reasonable if i take the 3 firewood and you get 3 food . we got several big hikes over the weekend and into next week so i would really like 2 waters and 1 for you all . <eos> YOU: completely agree on 3 firewood for me and 3 food for you . good job figuring that out ! even though my family is only planning on one hike , it's my whole extended family with me ( mother , father , 3 siblings , 5 cousins , 2 aunts , and 2 uncles ) . and we forgot to pack iodine pills so we can't purify any river water . would you be willing for me to take 2 waters ? sorry it doesn't distribute exactly evenly <eos> THEM: that ; s going to be tough on us , we got some long hikes planned and really need to stay hydrate . will all of the cousins and family be hiking with you ? <eos> YOU: yeah all of them are coming , it's basically our family reunion and we rented out half the campground to have enough room for all of us aha <eos> THEM: ok . i can make do with the 3 firewood and 1 water if we make the deal now before my mother - in - law and wife get back . <eos> YOU: perfect , i agree that would be ideal ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=3 item2=2 item0=3 item1=0 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: how's it going ? if it's alright with you , you can have all of the water and i'll take all of the firewood . we can work out a deal on the food as well . <eos> YOU: i have circulatory issued due to a heart condition and cold quickly . i would appreciate if i could get at least 2 of the firewood . you can have 2 of the food so you won't get hungry . <eos> THEM: i was planning on building a big bonfire for the evening . there'd be plenty of room if you wanted to join for warmth . i'm a bit hungry and would appreciate the extra food . you can have all of the water if you'd like . if you warm it by the bonfire , it may be useful to soak in to improve your circulation . <eos> YOU: i get tired to easy so i probably won't be much fun at a bonfire . i really do appreciate the offer though . i would think the extra food would do you more good for your party . <eos> THEM: the extra food would be appreciated . how about if i take just two each of the firewood and food , and you can have the remainder , plus all of the water ? <eos> YOU: i am just concerned that only 1 firewood might make it so i'm too cold to function . <eos> THEM: if you boil the water above the fire , it will provide additional heat over time . you would also be able to make tea , which would warm you up from the inside as well , better than any fire would . that would probably be most beneficial to you . i really do need the 2 firewood if there's any chance of making a bonfire for my party . <eos> YOU: i am allergic to tea and coffee . i wonder if the smaller fire would be more quaint for everyone to sit around . <eos> THEM: it really wouldn't do the job that well at all . you could always prepare hot cocoa or use your share of the food to make a warm stew . i really do need at least the two firewood and a couple of food . you can have all the water to make a hearty and hot stew to get your through the night , though . <eos> YOU: i can't eat much anyway because of the health issues . you could have all of the food if i could get the extra firewood . that would still give you an extra firewood in addition to the basic supply and lots of extra food for your party . i'm sure they would love having some of the stew you mentioned . <eos> THEM: well , how about i take just the one extra firewood , plus all of the food , and one of the water so that i can make stew ? would that work for you ? <eos> YOU: that sounds good . i hope your party is wonderful . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi , how are you ? <eos> THEM: great how are you ? ! <eos> YOU: doing well . so what do you think is the most important for your trip ? <eos> THEM: firewood and water are most important . we're planning on taking an over night hike so we'll need the supplies to take with us to make a fire at the end of the evening . the temperatuers are also higher than normal so we need to make sure we're hydrated . <eos> YOU: since the temperatures are higher , do you think you'd have a fire running all the time or all that often outside of cooking food ? <eos> THEM: i'm thinking a fire to keep the bugs away and to cook dinner . the smoke will allow us to be more comfortable and less likely to get bitten by bugs . <eos> YOU: hmm , i can understand that . i think for me , our location has temperatures that drop quite a bit at night so we would need it as a heat source . there really isn't an option for us to sleep without a fire going all night <eos> THEM: so could i do: 1 firewood , all the water and 2 food ? <eos> YOU: i could agree to that . we are near a water source so we could sanitize water if we needed it <eos> THEM: ok , that would work for me then . we are in agreeance ? <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=0 item0=1 item1=2 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi - i'm so excited for our camping trip . i'm most excited about getting to eat food that i normally don't when i am home . <eos> YOU: hello ! camper , how are you ? i need us to make a deal where we all benefit . <eos> THEM: i agree - i really love food . if i don't get it , i get hangry . if you're ok with me getting all the food , i think i can make it with just one firewood and one water . <eos> YOU: what do you think if in the camp we get together and hold a meeting between your family and mine . we can have a small party so that we get to know each other better . <eos> THEM: that sounds like an excellent idea . i love meeting and getting to know others . <eos> YOU: my main objective for the camp is also food , since i have a large family and the amount of food they give in the camp is very small for my whole family . <eos> THEM: i can do without one of the food , so maybe i can get 2 food , 2 firewood , and 1 water ? <eos> YOU: i do not like the deal very much , but for that we must talk and decide as adults a good deal for both of us . what we want is to enjoy in the camp . <eos> THEM: agreed - i enjoy camping . a big part of that for me is that i get to eat food . if i don't eat , i don't enjoy it so camping is basically a buffet for me . i am pretty dead set on having at least two packages of food . i can negotiate the water and firewood . <eos> YOU: how many members are there in your family group ? to make a proposal taking into account the food you need according to your family group . <eos> THEM: i have me , my wife , and my four kids . they are all teenagers . you know how they go through food . <eos> YOU: before making a deal i like to talk to people , to get to know them better . and if we are going to make a proposal for a party between the two families in the camp , it is in our best interest to know each other better . <eos> THEM: understood , but i don't know anything about you . i've offered a lot of information about me . this is a two - way street . <eos> YOU: my family is made up of my wife , my five children and me . all my children are minors , but they eat too much . when they don't eat they get very restless . <eos> THEM: i think one teenage kid is equivalent to young children . the least i'm willing to accept is 2 food , 2 firewood , and 1 water . i don't see another option as you haven't provided me any . let me know so we can get on our own camping trips . <eos> YOU: ok , my proposal is to give you everything you need for food , because you have given me good reasons , on the condition that you give me everything i need for water and firewood . because i can take some food to cook in the camp and i need a lot of firewood and water . <eos> THEM: what is your proposal . everything meaning you get 3 firewood and 3 water is not going to work for me . let me know . <eos> YOU: my proposal is to give you 2 foods , 1 water and 1 wood . i need water and firewood to cook in the camp . unless you want 2 for water , 2 for reading , and 1 for food ? <eos> THEM: no thanks - i don't think we're going to come to a deal . i hope you enjoy your camping trip . <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: reject - deal <eos> YOU: reject - deal <eos> YOU: i can offer you this other treatment: 3 food , 0 firewood and 1 water . i'm giving you all the food . what does it say ? <eos> THEM: i'm going to go ahead and walk away from this deal . i think it's not going to work for us so i wish you , your spouse , and five children a ton of fun on your camping trip . <eos>  </dialogue> <output> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi , we are going to be camping neighbors it seems like . <eos> YOU: hi ! it does seem that way . do you have any kids ? <eos> THEM: yes actually , 2 of them . a boy and girl . <eos> YOU: nice , maybe ours can play together some . i know mine seem to fight less when they have other people to play with <eos> THEM: i think having extra kids around always helps keep them out of trouble . <eos> YOU: it looks like we have some extra packages that need to be divvied up . is there anything you prefer ? <eos> THEM: i was just going to ask you the same question . i would prefer more firewood considering there isn't much to source at the camp site and all our sleeping bags are for lighter weather . i'd like to keep the kids warm . other than that water would be nice too . they always dump it out thinking they are watering plants . . : ( <eos> YOU: we brought plenty of water and a filtration system because i am anal about hydration . <eos> THEM: that's always a good thing . i had one but the kids left it in the sand . . . what packages do you feel you need most ? <eos> YOU: my kids eat all the time so i can take the food and you can take the water and that will leave the firewood . i wish they had 4 packages so we could divide it evenly . we cook mostly on the fire and always sit around the fire at night . <eos> THEM: that would be nice , it would make things abit more fair . i really need a little fire wood for keeping the kids more warm though . i can bring a propane stove so i think 1 extra bundle would work for us . i wouldn't mind giving up 2 food for you and the kids , i can manage with what i have on hand and i can take 2 waters . does that seem fair ? <eos> YOU: sounds good . i will take 2 food , 2 firewood and 1 water leaving you with the rest . <eos> THEM: i think that's fair and works for me . i don't mind a little challenge stretching things with the kids . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>

( there's a total of three of each item . ) if so , for the extra , i think " food + wood " goes together better . how about one of us takes the extra water , and the other takes the extra food & wood ? <eos> THEM: yes , my mistake . i mean you take 1 food package , 1 firewood package , and 1 water package , and then i will do the same . then , you can take the food and wood and i will take the extra package of water ! <eos> YOU: that works beautifully ! i hope you'll have a wonderful camping trip . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 9 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi , have you been camping before ? from prior experience , i know it's vital to have extra supplies for this trip . what are your thoughts ? <eos> THEM: hello ! i have camped before and am looking forward to our trip ! i really enjoy a good , hot cup of coffee and would like to be confident that we'll be able to have a roaring campfire with as much firewood as we can . what do you think we should be able to take with us ? <eos> YOU: i too love a hot cocoa or tea , so we'll definitely need water , firewood is next up , and food is obvious i think we can take as much as we are allowed . if you wanted , i could take all the food , we could split the water , and you could take all or most of the firewood ? <eos> THEM: i must admit that i prefer coffee over tea , but agree we need a lot of firewood to heat it up . i'm not sure we would be able to find enough dry material to burn , so would appreciate all of the firewood . thank you ! as for water - i would agree with splitting it if i could have 2 please ? <eos> YOU: am i to understand you want all of the firewood , and most of the water ? that doesn't quite work for me , i would agree to all of the food , 1 of the waters if i could get one of the firewood ? i will live without the extra cups of tea <eos> THEM: you are correct . i do propose that i take 3 firewood and 2 water . i you initially asked to take all of the food which i would be agreeable to , but because i would have to solely eat off of what i find . therefore i think i need extra water to cook / boil what i find . how am i supposed to stay hydrated while foraging , since i wouldn't have any food ? <eos> YOU: i think it would be pointless to have food and nothing to drink . we should try and reach an amicable agreement tho , and based on our preferences being so similar , a rational split would seem most fair and favorable for the both of us . how about i take 2 food , 1 water , and 1 firewood ? <eos> THEM: i think we are close to an agreement . thank you for discussing this so openly ! is your main objective to get at least 1 of each type of item ? <eos> YOU: yes it is , as i know one can't work without the other , especially out in the wilderness ! <eos> THEM: i agree that they are all important . to help us both - what if you take 1 of each item and i carry the heavier weight of 2 of each ? that way you reach your goal of 1 of each item and don't have so much to lug around ! that would allow you to enjoy your camping trip so much better . <eos> YOU: as generous as that sounds , i don't feel that deal is fair at all . my goal isn't one of each , but being a frequent camper , i know what i personally need to be out in the woods . i can also carry a good amount of weight , i'm a strong girl <eos> THEM: i think we can agree on wood: you get 1 , i get 2 . i think we can agree on food: you get 1 , i get 2 . let's call those items as agreed upon . we're down to negotiating on water i believe . i'd hate for us to lose a great deal over 1 bottle of water . : ( i really need 2 bottles of water please . <eos> YOU: i'd hate to leave the deal too , the best i can go for is 2 of the food , 1 of the water , and 1 of the firewood if you really need the water . i can't do anything on 1 of each , i want you to have your coffee , but i have to think about me too i can do 2 food , 1 water , 1 firewood . i believe that covered your preference of more water and firewood in your first request ? i thought you'd be happy with that compromise <eos> THEM: to confirm - you'll take 1 wood , 1 water , and 2 food ? i can agree to that . <eos> YOU: yes , and thank you for being so kind , a real gentleman <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi , i am looking at extra items for my camping trip and would like to have 3 firewoods , 3 foods and 2 waters . <eos> THEM: hey , i am excited to go camping too ! would you mind sharing your top priority items with me so that we can come up with a fair deal ? ideally i would love 3 firewoods , 3 foods , and 2 waters just like you aha . but perhaps we can each get at least 3 packages of our highest priority item <eos> YOU: hmmm , i think i really need the firewood . i brought softwoods and they burn out quickly so i don't think i'll have enough wood to keep me going through the night . i get kinda scared without the fire . what is your priority ? <eos> THEM: okay , well firewood is also my top priority since it will be so cold tonight . but i would be willing to take only 1 firewood ( and give you 2 ) as long as i got 2 foods and 2 waters <eos> YOU: thank you for the offer on firewood . i think that sounds fair . however , i really would like at least 2 waters as well . <eos> THEM: hmm unfortunately i can't budge since i would be accepting less of my top priority item . it sounds fair to me though ; i'd get 5 items in total but less of my top priority and you would get 4 items in total but more of your top priority <eos> YOU: well , how about if i take 2 firewoods and all of the food and you can have all of the waters ? i have a device that i can make clean water , but will need more calories to do so ! <eos> THEM: can't do ! water is my lowest priority since i already brought iodine drops to purify water myself aha . i still think it's fair if i get 1 firewood 2 food and 2 water ( or if it helps you to feel better , i can take 2 firewood and 1 food and 1 water ) <eos> YOU: ok . . . then how about if i just take 2 firewood , 1 water , and just 1 food ? i think that is what you proposed before . <eos> THEM: yup that works for me ! <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , i think i have a deal to split up the supplies , if i take 3 of the water and 2 of the firewood , would you accept all of the food and the rest of the firewood ? <eos> THEM: hi there ! that actually sounds like a pretty great deal . <eos> YOU: okay sure ! i am mostly interested in the water , i had to give some of my water away earlier to a family that needed some , and now i'm afraid of running out ! is there any item that you prefer ? <eos> THEM: food is my main priority . i am set on water , so i don't mind if you take all three . one firewood would be okay , but if i could take two , it would be ideal . <eos> YOU: okay , i think we have that part settled . i can take all the water and you can take the food . we just need to figure out how to split the wood ! my family didn't bring as much as we thought we needed from home , so a couple more would be useful for us . <eos> THEM: i am in the same boat . i don't have as much as i need to stay as long as i had planned . <eos> YOU: why do you need more food anyway ? did something happen ? <eos> THEM: i shared some food with some folks i met on the trail . i thought i had enough to last , but i'm getting low . i haven't hiked this much in a while and i am hungrier than i though i'd be ! i'm afraid of running too low since i am camping on my own . you said you are camping with your family ? <eos> YOU: yeah , we lost some of our food because i think some animals got into it . i guess we didn't store it right , too easy for them to get into it . but we brought a lot , so i think we are good on food . <eos> THEM: well it works out that you are good on food and i am good on water ! we just need to figure out the firewood . <eos> YOU: yeah , we thought we might be able to collect firewood out here so we didn't bring as much . but park rangers told us that we're not supposed to do that <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello ! i'm looking forward to making a deal . let's find something that works for us both . <eos> YOU: hello there . i am absolutely interested in coming to an agreement as well . it's pleasant to meet you ! <eos> THEM: nice to meet you too . so what do you need most ? <eos> YOU: so , i'm a chef . my largest concern is getting a nice , hot , fire . in order to do that i'll need firewood the most . what are you looking for the most ? <eos> THEM: that's awesome ! i am most definitely not a chef , but i'm going to be doing a lot of hiking , so i'll need a lot of water to stay hydrated . and a bit of extra food to keep us all full . <eos> YOU: fair enough . i'm also going to need a bit of water , but i'm sure we can come to an agreement fair for both of us . as far as food goes , i only require very little , my pantry already is pretty stocked there . <eos> THEM: well , if i take 2 waters and you take 1 , will you let me have all of the food ? <eos> YOU: i think that's asking a bit too much , because i still would like some food . i'd be willing to take all the firewood , one water , and one food , if that sounds passable to you . <eos> THEM: well , if i'm splitting the food and water with you , i'd like a single firewood . i'm no chef , but it'll be freezing cold overnight , and i just need a little extra to keep warm . <eos> YOU: i must insist on the firewood , that's the most important thing to me - you should have enough from your default package for a nice fire . i could use more water , but i'm letting you take the lions share of that , so i think one food isn't too unfair for that . <eos> THEM: okay , that's fair . you put in the deal , and i'll gladly accept . <eos> YOU: alrighty . hope you have fun on your hiking ! make sure you stay hydrated . going to push it through now . <eos> THEM: sounds good , you have fun , too ! and good luck cooking up all that food , chef ! <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: i would like to get 3 of the extra food packets and 1 firewood <eos> THEM: hello . how are you . that is a lot considering my issue that i have - i need to eat or at least snack something multiple times a day , otherwise i won't be able to function on this trip . i was hoping to get 3 food as well . not sure if i could do 2 . <eos> YOU: oh maybe we can work something out , i need the extra food packets as my children will be with me . even if i dont eat , i need for them to have plenty . could i get 2 food packets and 2 of the firewood packs ? <eos> THEM: i could possible consider 2 firewood packs if i get all 3 food ? <eos> YOU: i cant give up the 3 food packets , my kids will starve . the most i can do is give you 1 food packet , 1 firewood and 2 of the extra waters <eos> THEM: i might not be able to go to the trip then . i understand that we all do get basic packets already . unfortunately - as i said - i would be not able to function there properly . i understand your concern but i am sorry . <eos> YOU: well if we walk away we both suffer , lets try to think about all that is involved . unfortunately , we cant split the 3rd food packet . i think i should take the 2 food packets since children are involved . how can we split the rest of the items to make it fair . <eos> THEM: i cannot even think further about getting anything . i know i will suffer if i go without these supplies . so for me it would be not good one way or the other . plus firewood is another crucial thing because i get so cold and would need to constantly keep warm . so these two things both are crucial . <eos> YOU: how about this i will share 1 food packet with my kids . i would need 2 firewood packs , and the 3 extra waters . that way you can have the 2 food packets <eos> THEM: in that case you are getting way more supplies . this is why i was already saying earlier - one way or the other i would suffer because firewood is also so important . and if i am not getting more food - that is also not good , because water can help with food cravings . <eos> YOU: that deal would give you 2 food packets , and 1 extra firewood . that is a fair trade - off <eos> THEM: 3 - 6 ? i don't consider that fair , i am sorry . <eos> YOU: so you get 2 food packets , 1 firewood , and 1 water . it is very fair food is mych more valuable then the other items and was your deciding factoe to go or not to go , you will have more food than myself and 3 kids . it is very fair . <eos> THEM: i might be able to be ok with that - as i said - water could help deal with extra food cravings . <eos> YOU: yes , we would have less food but a little extra water to help with that . can we agree on me getting 1 food packet , 2 firewood packets , and 2 waters ? <eos> THEM: ok . <eos> YOU: that means you get 2 food , 1 firewood , and 1 water , correct ? <eos> THEM: ok <eos> YOU: alright i hope we both have a fun trip ! ! ! <eos> THEM: i hope so , as well . enjoy . i am sorry , i am just worried for my conditions . . . thank you . <eos> YOU: no worries ! ! ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , how are you doing ? <eos> THEM: not too good . i was robbed earlier before my camping trip with my boy . i need more items so i can take him on a camping trip that i've promised him for almost 6 months now . <eos> YOU: oh that is a shame . i am currently training for a marathon in greenland and i am trying to maintain my weight during this trip . what did they steal from you ? <eos> THEM: well after leaving the grocery , i put my groceries in my car and then got into the driver's seat . when i sat down , a man pointed his gun at me and told me to put my wallet in the center console and then get out the car . he took my car , wallet and all of my groceries . there were 3 packages of water , 3 bundles of firewood and 3 packages of food . <eos> YOU: i hope they catch that guy , well since you are close to our campsite we could cook something together . my husband brought his bow and fishing rod so i think we plan on getting some more food that way . <eos> THEM: that would be really nice of you , but my son is grown . he has a hearty appetite . i really need to feed him his snacks because he is austic and throws tantrums if he doesn't eat particular foods . same goes with water . <eos> YOU: i understand , our nephew has autism as well but not much of an appetite . we could also let you borrow the fishing rod and go out with your son for some bonding time . if you catch a fish or two that could help the trade on how much food i would be willing to give up . i am horribly afraid of darkness , so i would like more than enough firewood . <eos> THEM: if you could provide us with the food , it would be greatly appreciated . i recently lost my job so i was trying to take my boy on a trip to also get my mind off of things . i won't eat throughout the week if you can provide 2 fish ; however , if you did have a spare and could make it three , that would be greatly appreciated . one thing about the robbery that makes me really upset is that this guy took our firewood . i walked home after calling the police and was able to stop by a local park . there was some sticks i gathered to bring with us , but it won't last . any chance you can spare a few bundles ? <eos> YOU: hmmm , we picked up the firewood when we arrived the campsite because the park rangers do not want people bringing invasive pests to the area . i am horribly terrified of the dark and we are taking this trip for my husbands birthday . if it gets too dark i will not be able to sleep and it will not be good for my mental preparation for my marathon i have at the end of the month . i would really prefer to hand out more food than firewood since my husband is an amazing fisherman and i also enjoy eating squirrel . <eos> THEM: well how about this , i won't bother you about the firewood . i know it is something that seems beneficial to your well being . i can totally relate to that . for me , i would honestly rather any food you can spare , but my concern is water . it being the summer and a drought now , i don't think we'll make it through the weekend without any water . i can't afford any . do you think you can possibly provide us with 3 fish and 3 packages of water ? <eos> YOU: ok , i can give you two packages of food and two waters , we should be okay boiling our water . since my husband will be hunting for the extra food we will clean it and cook it , so can you give 2 packages of firewood ? <eos> THEM: i have no firewood . i have nothing ! i was robbed . if you want 1 package of firewood , i can give you 1 . however , i am going to need more food and water . i have sjorgren's syndrome . it causes me to dry out . my eyes , throat and really my full body gets dried up . its caused me to convulse in the past and have seizures . if something happens to me when i'm out in the words . who will take care of my boy ? i need to make sure i don't have an accident out there or they may take my son away from me . <eos> YOU: well we will be nearby . camping sounds a little dangerous with your condition . i suggest since you have no supplies to really offer that you stay next to our camp and share our fire . the ranger will give you the firewood upon arrival , if you give up the all 3 packages of firewood i will provide 2 food and 2 waters . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: i would like to offer you all of the water and one additional package of food . i will take the firewood and 2 pckages of food . <eos> THEM: hello . thank you for your offer , however that will not be a good deal for me or you as water is important to have on a camping trip . have you been camping before ? <eos> YOU: yes . if rain is in the forcast , i can collect rainwater . what is your counter offer ? <eos> THEM: i understand , but if it does not rain you will have to think about that . i offer that i can take 2 firewood , 2 food , and 1 water . therfore , you can have 1 firewood , 1 food , and 2 water . <eos> YOU: that's kind of you , but i have small children and need to make sure they stay warm at night . how about you take 2 water , 2 food , and 1 firewood ? i will take 2 firewood , 1 water and 1 food . <eos> THEM: in the case , wouldn't it be better if you take more food and water , since children can get more hungry and they tend to go to bed earlier , so you wont need as much firewood . what is your priority for the trip of items to have ? i generally like to stay away very late in the evening to watch the stars , which is why i am leaning more towards more firewood than water . <eos> YOU: that's interesting . looking at the stars is very entertaining . however , children can get hypothermia rather quickly . also fire keeps predators away . therefore , i would prefer more firewood in order to keep my children warm and safe . <eos> THEM: i can understand that , but that is why its important to bring more blankets to protect them . in that case , what if i take 1 firewood , 3 food and 2 waters and then you can have 2 firewood and 1 water since firewood seems to be that much more important for you . <eos> YOU: sadly , blankets don't protect against most predators . i am again offering you 2 water , 2 food , and 1 firewood . <eos> THEM: it seems that we both prefer to have firewood the most , so i think if that is the case and you take more firewood , then i think that i should have more of something else as i've stated above . dont you agree ? <eos> YOU: yes , i do agree . there are 9 items available ; i am offering you 5 and i get 4 . <eos> THEM: that is fine by me . <eos> YOU: great . i am glad we can agree <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </input> <dialogue> YOU: it's so good to be talking to you before this historic camping trip we're all going to be going on . you're gonna love it . but before we go , we need to figure out the best deal for everybody , and that's what i want . i want all of us to win . tell me , what do you need most in the world ? i'm gonna get that for you . <eos> THEM: that would be awesome ! i really need some more water . i need it so that i can take my medications with it . it's very important to me . to get this , i'm willing to give you as much firewood as you need . how does that sound to you ? <eos> YOU: that's tough , real tough . everybody wants you to be able to take your medicine , and it wold be terrific if you could , but everyone has to make sacrifices for the greater good . i need all of the water . non negotiable . that sounds tough , i know , but i'm ready to give you the deal of a life time for it . a deal you've never seen before and won't see again . i'll take all the water , it's true , but in return i'm offering you two wood and all the food . a dynamite deal . <eos> THEM: oh wow . that is tough . that is a good deal . may i ask - why do you need the water ? <eos> YOU: the world is a scary place out there , it's getting tougher for us regular people to get by , especially with companies dumping chemicals in our water supplies , poisoning us . i'm pledging to my camping group , we're gonna have the cleanest water around . so clean they won't believe it . frankly even i don't believe it and i'm seeing it with my own eyes . they're gonna love it . <eos> THEM: i think that's a very noble cause . maybe other people in our camping group can supply some water ? i'd be more than happy to give you two waters , and i will take just 1 water for myself , even though i need it very badly for my health . <eos> YOU: you're making this tough for me . real tough . i'm not a bad guy though . i'm willing to help the people even if i don't agree wit them . it's going to cost you though . if you get one water , i'm going to need two wood . you scratch my back , i scratch yours . everybody gets the best deal . you're making out like a bandit with all the food . that'll be terrific for you . <eos> THEM: how important is the wood to you ? ideally , how many would you need ? <eos> YOU: if you're getting one water , i have to have two wood . i'm already breaking my pledge not to negotiate on the water . that's huge . i have to come out of this looking strong for my people . they're not going to like seeing me break on such a big pledge i made . you get one water , one wood and three food . that'll be big for you , getting the entire stack like that . huge ! <eos> THEM: i think this is a fair proposal . . . i'll be willing to give up two of my wood ( even though it is very high priority ) since you are generous enough to give me a water . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi , i would like all of the water and 2 food packages . you can have all of the firewood and one food package . does that sound good ? <eos> YOU: nice to meet you ! i definitely like the idea of having all of the firewood , but water is very important to me . let's see if we can come to and agreement on how to split up the water . <eos> THEM: i typically drink a lot of water every day . so i can't agree with much less on that ! <eos> YOU: alright , i'm sure we can something that works for both of us . the location i'm camping in is only accessible by foot , so i anticipate that i'll need a little more water than normal to feel completely safe . is there any water source nearby your campsite ? <eos> THEM: nothing that i would trust . additionally , i have a dog that will need water as well . <eos> YOU: oh well that is something to consider . i love dogs . . i'd be willing to take less in that case , and let you have 2 of the waters . would you be ok with leaving me with 1 ? i'd be willing to split the food up the same way ( you get 2 , i get 1 ) . <eos> THEM: that works . i know water is important . i promise i won't be using it to water plants or wash clothes ! <eos> YOU: haha of course ! i think we've come to a good agreement then ! you get the 2 waters , and i get water . you get 2 foods , and i get 1 food . and i get the 3 firewoods . correct ? <eos> THEM: that is perfect for me and my dog ! yes ! <eos> YOU: perfect ! i'll submit the deal shortly . what type of dog do you have ? <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: i would like you to have the extra food because we have a high need for water . <eos> YOU: sure that works for me ! i'd like extra firewood so that we can ward off any wild animals and so we can see that night . and to roast marshmallows around a campfire :d <eos> THEM: sounds good however my camping buddy is unusually thin and gets chilled quickly . i am hoping the extra food will be worth two firewoods for us . you can still roast marshmellos with the wood you already have . <eos> YOU: if your camping buddy is unusually thin , i feel like it'll be best for you folks to have more food . i'm willing to sacrifice a bit of food for more water instead . how about you guys take 2 units of food and i'll keep one ? eating food will help you stay warm since your body temperature goes up <eos> THEM: that is a good idea ! we can give you a water and your can give us a food . i will encourage him to eat because he has weight problems . are you otherwise okay with our distribution ? <eos> YOU: awesome , i'm glad we can agree on that :d since i'm not getting any extra food , is it possible for me to have more firewood ? having just water isn't going to be able to sustain us , i'll need the firewood to cook some fish that we'll need to catch on our own <eos> THEM: how about you have 2 firewood units , 1 water , and 1 food . we can wrap up if we get cold . oh , and good luck fishing ! <eos> YOU: hey , that sounds fantastic ! :d i'm all about being one with nature and enjoying what the wilderness has to offer lol . <eos> THEM: camping is great and i am glad you do not have to depend on your fishing to eat . it looks like we are in agreement with the extra provisions . just check the chart to be sure i did it as we agreed ! <eos> YOU: sure thing ! i hope you two have a wonderful camping trip ! make sure he eats okay ? <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hy thats my offer <eos> THEM: hi there . . i'm sorry , i didn't see your offer as it doesn't show it for 10 messages , i believe . so , here's the situation . . i think i can get by with less firewood as i'm a floridian and prefer it cooler anyway . . also the food is not a huge thing for me as we can catch / improvise around the campsite - but i'm definitely interested in as much water as possible . . both for cooking and cleaning purposes , as well as drinking , of course . <eos> YOU: okay so what do you suggest <eos> THEM: well , i recognize you're gonna need water too . . so i'd love to take 2 of them , giving you one and i'm totally ok with going 1 on the firewood and one on the food . . that way we all ensure we have enough . . you're making out a bit better in quantity that way but i think its best for both of us <eos> YOU: i botttle of water for a can of food and 2 firewoods <eos> THEM: yeah , sorry , that's not going to work out for me . i'm going to need at least 2 bottles of water , 1 food packet , and one firewood . . again , this does leave you with two each on the food and the firewood , which are both very important things for this camping trip ! <eos> YOU: but thats the only offer im willing to give <eos> THEM: well then unfortunately i think we're gonna have to walk away from this and neither of us gets anything we could both use . . that's unfortunate and i'm sorry to see it end in such a less than magnanimous fashion <eos> YOU: you need water and i need food so unless we do 1 food to 1water is tht okay <eos> THEM: i'll tell you what i'm willing to do . . i can't really budge on the water . . but . . i could do something where i take 2 water , and only one firewood , but two food . . does that work for you ? <eos> YOU: so if i were to give you water what would i get ? <eos> THEM: you'd be getting 1 water , 2 firewood , and 1 food <eos> YOU: how much food are you willing to offer for water <eos> THEM: we can go back to my original offer which was honestly more generous . . i get 2 water , 1 firewood , 1 food . . you get 1 water , 2 firewood , 2 food . . its honestly a better deal for you <eos> YOU: no its not i give you i water i get 1 food and 1 firewood <eos> THEM: we only have 3 of each to divide up . . so yes , you're going to have to give me one more on an item . . but in exchange i'm giving you 1 more on two different items . i'm getting 4 items in total , you're getting 5 . . - you're essentially netting 11 % more 'items' than i am in this deal . <eos> YOU: thats the point as you need water so badly <eos> THEM: correct . . i do . . but if you're not willing to budge on this where you're still netting more overall value i understand - i'm bummed but i understand . <eos> YOU: im contented with what i have but im willing to trade as yu need more water so i need t make a profit <eos> THEM: that's unfortunate then as instead of making a tiny bit less of a profit now you're not going to make any because you would rather give up the deal . also , if you do the math , you'll see that i'm actually benefiting you here - i understand , though . i can put through the offer and hope you change your mind so we both benefit . <eos> YOU: im fine with that <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi as a starting point i just put in an initial proposal <eos> YOU: i'm unable to see your proposal . i'm hoping to get at least 2 additional packages of firewood . i forgot my sleeping bag and blankets , so extra firewood would help me stay warm at night . <eos> THEM: i was hoping for two packages of firewood as well . . . i would need it to heat the food and water <eos> YOU: i would be willing to give you the 2 packages of firewood if i'm able to take all of the food and one water . my dog is coming on the camping trip and i'm worried with all the extra activity he won't have enough food and water packed for the weekend . <eos> THEM: i would need one food and one water in addition to the firewood . alternatively , you can have 2 firewoods if i could have 2 foods and 2 waters <eos> YOU: i would feel better about our trip if i was able to have 2 firewood 1 food and 2 waters . is that something you would be interested in doing ? i think i can make do on the food , but extra water for my pup would be ideal . <eos> THEM: so if you have the extra firewood you can boil water at the campsite for your dog . i am a dog lover as well and want to be sure they are taken care of . i propose we set up a ratio of 2to 1 for firewood and water ( if you get two firewood you get one water and vice versa ) that seems they only way for us both to have something that we can work with <eos> YOU: i appreciate that you're a fellow dog lover . i hadn't thought about boiling water . a 2:1 ratio seems fair to me . <eos> THEM: how about if the person who get the two firewood ( which seems to be the most desirable entity ) only gets 1 food and the person who gets the lesser valued water gets the extra food . that seems fair to me <eos> YOU: i can agree with that . the firewood is my biggest concern because i forgot the blankets ! as long as i'm warm , i should be able to make do on 1 food and 1 water . <eos> THEM: okay so i propose you get two firewood , one water and one food . i get one firewood , two food and two water . do you agree ? <eos> YOU: yes , i agree . i'll submit the deal now . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>

" can you clarify ? <eos> YOU: what i mean by prevention of excess is that we should focus on getting excess and not to limit it regardless of what we already have because if we should offer some creative approaches by excess . we can both come to an agreement if you are interested . <eos> THEM: okay . lets just try to do some negotiation . i am the most interested in getting more water . the water i already have at the campsite looks dirty so , if it is okay with you , i would like all three of them . my food has also been stolen by bears and i don't make much left , so i would like two of the food items . you can have all the firewood and the other food item . how does that sound ? <eos> YOU: sound good enough but since you know i can not do without having anything to sustain me whenever i am thirsty then i suggest you are free to take two of the water and since your food has also been stolen by bears and you don't make much left , then you can have the two of the food items too and leave the three firewood for me with one food . how does that sound ? <eos> THEM: i think we are getting very close to a good deal . would you be willing to give me one firewood in case the stuff i have gets wet ? <eos> YOU: i strongly agree and shall we call it a deal now ? <eos> THEM: like i said , we are close but i really would feel better with just one of the firewood . i'm afraid of not being able to build a fire . if you really need the firewood , however , then i would take one additional item of either the water or food instead . <eos> YOU: and like i said , i strongly agree and you can have one firewood now . deal close ? <eos> THEM: yes . i think this is a fair deal . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi there . i'm hoping we can make a deal about me getting firewood . i get really cold at night and i'd love to have my fire still going in the morning for coffee - i'd gladly share some if you pop by my campsite . <eos> YOU: i am in dire need of firewood myself . i was planning on bringing food that needed to be cooked over flame . <eos> THEM: well maybe we can find a way to split it ! this isn't a problem we can't solve . are you in need of food too , then ? <eos> YOU: that would be great ! i don't need food as much as i am in need of firewood , to be honest . <eos> THEM: i brought purification tablets so i can make do with rainwater or river water . how about you ? <eos> YOU: that's very smart ! way to be prepared ! i didn't think to do that . <eos> THEM: so if we were to split the firewood more in your favor and i were to take all the food , and then we kind of split the water , i think we could maybe make a deal here ? <eos> YOU: i think that is definitely doable ! i'd be glad to make a deal with you . thanks for being so reasonable ! <eos> THEM: so i'm proposing 1 firewood to me , 2 to you . 3 food to me . and 2 water to me , 1 to you . can we work with that ? firewood seems to be important to the both of us so i'm giving up things here . <eos> YOU: yes i think that will work just fine . firewood is important especially because i usually find my food in the woods . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=1 item0=1 item1=3 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>
