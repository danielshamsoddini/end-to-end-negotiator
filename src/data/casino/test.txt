I am camping in the desert with a bunch of children and need to make sure they stay hydrated. I propose I take 2 waters 1 food and 1 firewood. <eos> YOU: I really need the firewood, I have health issues and I have to keep warm at night.   <eos> THEM: Ok how about you take all the firewood and 1 food package? and ill take the water and 2 food packages.  <eos> YOU: I need some water.  How about I get the firewood, two waters, and you can have all the food? <eos> THEM: I need at least 2 waters and 1 food  to keep the children hydrated and fed. <eos> YOU: Okay, how about I get the firewood and one water, you get 2 waters and one food? <eos> THEM: how about i get 2 waters and 2 foods. you get all the firewood and 1 food and 1 water.  that way the kids can stay hydrated and fed in the desert and you can have firewood to keep you warm with your health condition and some food and water too. <eos> YOU: That works for me.

My first priority is firewood, my second is water and third is food. How about you? <eos> THEM: Perfect! What would you think about if we divided it up so you could have all 3 firewood then, and we could split water and food?  <eos> YOU: Would you be willing to give me 3 firewood, I'll give you 3 water or food, which ever you need more and we split the rest. What do you say? <eos> THEM: We could work that out, to keep it even I'll give you the firewood, you can take all 3, and I can take 3 of one of my lower items, food. Then split water? <eos> YOU: Okay, so I'll take 3 firewood, you take 3 food and then how about you take 2 water and I'll take 1. Is that fair? <eos> THEM: That would be the fairest option I think!  <eos> YOU: Yep, I think that is fair as well! Okay so 3 firewood for me, 3 food for you, 2 water for you and 1 water for me. Do I have that right? <eos> THEM: Yup! It was a pleasure to be able to work together, thank you!  <eos> YOU: Same here. It was nice working with you!

It's very important to me and my family. How about I take 2 food and 3 firewood. You can take all the water <eos> YOU: You can have all the firewood, but I really would like 2 food.  My children are going to need plenty of energy if they are going to go hiking. <eos> THEM: The food is important to me as well. Since you ain't ready to allow me take 2 food, you will have to sacrifice some water then. I take 1 food, 3 firewood and 2 water. You can take the 2 food and 1 water since you won't be needing any firewood <eos> YOU: I would prefer taking 1 food, 3 water, and 0 firewood. <eos> THEM: Okay then <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=1 item2=3 item0=3 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

How do you feel about this <eos> YOU: I understand my friend, I have three children that are growing teenagers. Would you be willing to take extra water instead? <eos> THEM: Yes! But I would like 3 packages of water because I drink a Lot of water and I get dehydrated easily.  OK? <eos> YOU: I might be able to get you 3 packages of water, if you allow me to have three packages of food. <eos> THEM: OK..! That's fine because I don't eat a lot and can ration what I have this is alright with me, friend. <eos> YOU: I also need 2 packages of fire wood because my body doesn't regulate temperature well and the evenings can be quite cold.  <eos> THEM: No, problem about the Firewood, because I don't get cold easily!. I don't mind if you need 2 packages of firewood. <eos> YOU: You are very generous. Thank you my friend!   The firewood will be used to heat up my baby's formula.  <eos> THEM: Such a WORTHY reason - I couldn't stand in the way of such a good reason for extra firewood.  Are you readY to SUBMIT THE DEAL, ARE WE READY? <eos> YOU: I am concerned that I might not have enough water to mix the formula.  Would you be willing to accept 2 packages of water in stead of 3? If so, I am ready to submit the deal. Thank you for considering my humble request.  <eos> THEM: OK, I don't mind accepting 2 packages of water instead of 3, I don't feel this is unreasonable.  I see no reason to be selfish or greedy about it.  There is no reason to hoarder of water.  I can accept 2 packages of H2O.

So you would get 2 water, 1 firewood, 1 food.  I would get 1 water, 2 firewood, 2 food, correct? <eos> THEM: yeah that seems to be a little bit better. the other one would have one of us going without a backup for an emergency.  <eos> YOU: Makes sense.

We both require water to make it thru the camping trip <eos> THEM: Due to my blood pressure medicaton, I need to stay hydrated at all times. It is more important for me to drink rather than eat which is why I would give you more food in exchange for more water for me <eos> YOU: That is understandable but if you were to get the majority of the water I would want all the firewood and 2 packages of food  <eos> THEM: I am happy to give you 2 packs of food and the lions share of the firewood but I think I need 1 firewood. I am not a good firestarter <eos> YOU: So are you ok with me getting 1 package of water and 2 firewood and 2 food <eos> THEM: I am absolutely OK with that deal. <eos> YOU: Just need to make sure we are both have sufficient supplies because I dont know about you but living off the land would probably be disastrous for me <eos> THEM: I appreciate your concern.

It is in the hot, dry season so I may not have much for streams to try and boil water down that is safe to drink from.  I will also need some extra food due to the animals in the area maybe not being abundant.  I would be willing to cut my trip a day short since you need water more than I do. But could I then have a bit more food? <eos> THEM: I understand and would like to share some supplies with you. Do you mind if I take 2 water, 2 food and 1 firewood and you will have 2 firewood, 2 food and 2 water? <eos> YOU: I would be willing to give up all my firewood for 2 of the food.  I would take 1 of the water then.  I will have an abundance of firewood in the area to scavenge for so I really do not have any need for firewood. <eos> THEM: So you will have 2 food, 1 water and I will have 1 food, 2 water and 3 firewood. Is it correct? <eos> YOU: Yes. I believe that will get you far in your trip to get some herbs! I will be happy with my trip even though it will be cut short!  <eos> THEM: Thank you so much for your kind. I will submit this deal then.

<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: Hi.   Let's see how we can best divide up the extra supplies.   I am thinking that I really could use extra wood.  So how about I take 2 woods, an extra food, and 2 waters? <eos> THEM: Hold up buddy You come out without even asking my preferences or needs? What are you a millenial? <eos> YOU: Absolutely not.  I'm an old lady. LOL.  Of course,  we need to discuss your preferences and needs.  I just like to be forthright and get things rolling.  What are you thinking that you can use? <eos> THEM: Lol okay. No biggie. I am have a large family of 5  with 3 being kids and we are camping in the mountains this weekend. I sure could use most of the firewood for us to keep warm at night, I have poor blood circulation and kind of need it so I can function. The water is not a big deal to me. We can melt the snow for extra drinking water and boil it if need be. I would like one extra food too. <eos> YOU: I can relate to the need to keep warm at night!  Arthritis aches bad when I'm chilly.  It will be cold in the mountains for sure.  I can see you need extra.  How about you take 2?  I'm good on food so you can have what you need of that. Water would me nice.  If you can make do, I'd like at least 2 waters. <eos> THEM: That would work perfectly for us. I will take the 2 wood, 1 water and 3 food? Do you want a food? <eos> YOU: Yes, please. A food would be great.   <eos> THEM:  That will work for us. Thank you. You can have a food. <eos> YOU: Perfect.  I'm glad we could work this out!  Have fun with your family.  You will be making some great memories with your kids.   <eos> THEM: Absolutely, it is always about the kids and making lasting memories.

You can have the rest. <eos> YOU: oh, I'm sorry to hear about that... I think I can help with the water, but you need firewood as well? <eos> THEM: Well, just one would be beneficial.  I don't regulate my body heat as much as I used to. <eos> YOU: The reason I am asking, is because it gets very cold in the desert at night...and I may need that... but if all you need is one, I don't see why we couldn't make a deal <eos> THEM: that would be amazing - I know it does get cold so I definitely don't want you to be cold either.  I don't need any of the food - not much of an appetite right now anyway. <eos> YOU: Once again, really sad to hear about your condition..., but perhaps being in the great outdoors would be beneficial for your immune system?... So you need 3 water and 1 firewood? <eos> THEM: Yes, that would be great for me - would that work for you? <eos> YOU: Yep, I mostly need the firewood, but I can do with 2 packages...

I will not give it up for anything. What about you? <eos> YOU: I could use food, too. However, I'd consider giving up some food in exchange for other items. I could probably spread out my food ration if I got more of other items. <eos> THEM: Okay then . Let me present you my offer. I take 3 food, 2 firewood and 1 water. <eos> YOU: Wow, that's really not a good deal  If you get all the food then I would request 3 firewood and 3 water to even it out. Food is most important to both of us. <eos> THEM: I think it is a good deal.  <eos> YOU: It isn't. You're getting more items and all 3 of the highest value items.

It's the fairest deal. I am not going to be ripped off and will walk away if need be. <eos> THEM: You haven't changed your deal at all.

I can make one change and that would be I get one food given to me and I'll give you one firewood.  <eos> YOU: Reject-Deal <eos> THEM: Reject-Deal <eos> YOU: Reject-Deal <eos> YOU: You're wasting my time now.

So what do you think is the most important for your trip?  <eos> THEM: Firewood and water are most important. We're planning on taking an over night hike so we'll need the supplies to take with us to make a fire at the end of the evening. The temperatuers are also higher than normal so we need to make sure we're hydrated. <eos> YOU: Since the temperatures are higher, do you think you'd have a fire running all the time or all that often outside of cooking food?  <eos> THEM: I'm thinking a fire to keep the bugs away and to cook dinner. The smoke will allow us to be more comfortable and less likely to get bitten by bugs. <eos> YOU: Hmm, I can understand that. I think for me, our location has temperatures that drop quite a bit at night so we would need it as a heat source. There really isn't an option for us to sleep without a fire going all night <eos> THEM: So could I do: 1 firewood, all the water and 2 food? <eos> YOU: I could agree to that. We are near a water source so we could sanitize water if we needed it <eos> THEM: Ok, that would work for me then.

What if I give you one water? <eos> YOU: i could give you 3 of my firewood if you can do 2 water and 2 food, would that work? <eos> THEM: could we do it where I give you 1 water and 2 food?  <eos> YOU: I would you take all 3 firewood, for 2 water 1 food instead? <eos> THEM: so just to clarify, I would take all 3 firewood, and then I keep 1 water and 2 food? And you'd get 2 water and 1 food? <eos> YOU: yes that is correct . Sound like a deal? <eos> THEM: let me check one other thing - I really do need the water to stay hydrated. What if I only keep 2 firewood, and give you one firewood, 1 water, and 2 food? <eos> YOU: i do not need any fire wood but the other things I really need are water the most, since mine leaked. And food since I found a puppy and plan to share mine either way, but would be nice to have more. <eos> THEM: i guess we can do it where i keep all the firewood, and i give you 2 water and 1 food. <eos> YOU: that would be amazing!, hank you so much <eos> THEM: you're welcome. <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=1 item2=2 item0=3 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

I'd be willing to give you all the food if I could get most of the water and firewood.  <eos> YOU: I could definitely give you all 3 bundles of firewood, in exchange for 3 packages of food. I would be willing to give you 2 water, if you can give me 1 <eos> THEM: Yes that sounds like a good deal for all parties. I will send the offer when it's available.  <eos> YOU: Ok, looks like we need to hit a couple more back and forth conversations before it is available to submit. Do you want to just confirm what you will be entering for your deal? <eos> THEM: Ya sounds good. I will get three firewood, two water and zero food. You will get zero firewood, 1 water, and three food.  <eos> YOU: That's perfect. I have no complaints about the deal <eos> THEM: How are you doing this fine day. <eos> YOU: Doing great, thanks for asking! I'll go ahead and submit the deal as we agreed upon.

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello I am not asking for the world just sharing <eos> THEM: Great! Glad to hear that. What would you say your greatest need is in this? <eos> YOU: I am old. Old people need hydration, more than younger people. Are you younger? <eos> THEM: Ha! Youth is so subjective. I'm middle aged and plan on doing a lot of hiking, so I'm hoping to at least keep a hold of some water, but I'm definitely willing to split it with you. How do you feel about food and firewood? <eos> YOU: Food is low priortity. I don't expend much energy, so that is why it is expendable. <eos> THEM: Food's low priority for me as well. Water and firewood are really what I'm looking to have extras of because of where I'm camping. Do you think you need more firewood, or more water? <eos> YOU: Water is no 1. <eos> THEM: Ah alright. I have an offer for you. It sounds like water is very important to both of us, but I'm willing to give you the majority of the water if I'm able to keep the firewood.You get 2 waters and all 3 food, and I'll take the remainder. <eos> YOU: We are two exchanges away from 10, so let's agree, wish each other well and close with several more pleasant  exchanges. <eos> THEM: Agreed . I'll take 3 firewood and 1 water and you'll get everything else <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=3 item2=2 item0=3 item1=0 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

What are you most interested in securing? <eos> YOU: I have a big need for firewood and could also use some water <eos> THEM: Got it. My biggest need is water, but I'm happy to give you all the firewood if I can get all the water <eos> YOU: i think I could do that if you would be willing to give me 2 food <eos> THEM: Food is my 2nd most important item, would you be open to taking just 1? <eos> YOU: I would take one if you would give me 1 water. It's my 2nd most important <eos> THEM: OK let's just stick to this then. I get 3 water, 1 food, 0 firewood. you get 0 water, 2 food, 3 firewood. Does that work for you? <eos> YOU: That works for me. 3 fire, 0 water, 2 food.

How about you? <eos> THEM: Definitely hear that.  Some solitude would do me well.  Thanks for asking.  <eos> YOU: What is your favorite part about camping? <eos> THEM: The way it decompresses you, mentally, I'd say.  If that makes sense.   <eos> YOU: Yes, that does make sense.  Do you like to bring anything special on your camping trips? <eos> THEM: Camera and books for sure.  I tend to go on impromptu hikes though, and that requires extra calories.   <eos> YOU: Yes, i'm sure it does.  I always make sure to bring water because I get dehydrated very quickly. <eos> THEM: With that in mind, how would you like to split the extra packages of food and water?  I'll give you all the water for all the food, and we can split the remaining firewood.  <eos> YOU: That sounds like a good deal - except there is 3 packages of firewood so we can't split it evenly.  I am bringing my daughter along and I would hate for her to be cold.

<input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hello there. <eos> YOU: Hello, how are you? hoping today is finding you well. I am taking 40 kids camping. I was wondering if its okay if I can get all 3 foods, I am willing to trade all waters for it. I really need the extra supplies, since the needs of children differ than adults. In case, the food is not properly stored or if the kids eat more <eos> THEM: Interesting.  Well I do need some food, as I plan to go hiking.  For that I will need energy. <eos> YOU: Yes, its our annual youth camp. I completely understand needed an extra food. are you in need of firewood? maybe we can work something out with firewood and water for all 3 foods. My kiddos are little rascals and east everything on sight. <eos> THEM: If I have to shorten my hiking per day without extra food, I will need some heavy compensation because now it will take longer for me to reach my destination without energy.  Water alone will be hard. <eos> YOU: I completely understand, what do you have in mind? will you be hiking alone or do you have people coming along? <eos> THEM: I will be hiking alone on this trip.  I would consider giving you all the food.  I would need all the water and firewood in return.  The firewood would be helpful to keep animals away while I rest. <eos> YOU: I completely understand as I too was thinking of using firewood not to only keep wild life away, but the bugs. Will you be okay if i get one fire wood? I have alot of cooking to do. not sure if it will be raining when we go camping, and if it is raining, I am unsure if I will be able to use the tree branches and brush.. since they will be wet. what do you think?  <eos> THEM: I suppose I can give you one firewood. <eos> YOU: thank you so much. you are very kind, the kiddos will be happy to hear about the extra supplies. to recap I will be getting 3 waters 1 fire wood and 0 waters.  <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </partner_input>
<input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for us both. <eos> YOU: Hello there.  I am absolutely interested in coming to an agreement as well.  it's pleasant to meet you! <eos> THEM: Nice to meet you too. So what do you need most? <eos> YOU: So, I'm a chef.  My largest concern is getting a nice, hot, fire.  In order to do that I'll need firewood the most.  What are you looking for the most? <eos> THEM: That's awesome! I am most definitely NOT a chef, but I'm going to be doing a lot of hiking, so I'll need a lot of water to stay hydrated. And a bit of extra food to keep us all full. <eos> YOU: Fair enough.  I'm also going to need a bit of water, but I'm sure we can come to an agreement fair for both of us.  As far as food goes, I only require very little, my pantry already is pretty stocked there. <eos> THEM: Well, if I take 2 waters and you take 1, will you let me have all of the food? <eos> YOU: I think that's asking a bit too much, because I still would like some food.  I'd be willing to take all the firewood, one water, and one food, if that sounds passable to you. <eos> THEM: Well, if I'm splitting the food and water with you, I'd like a single firewood. I'm no chef, but it'll be freezing cold overnight, and I just need a little extra to keep warm. <eos> YOU: I must insist on the Firewood, that's the most important thing to me - you should have enough from your default package for a nice fire.  I could use more water, but I'm letting you take the lions share of that, so I think one food isn't too unfair for that. <eos> THEM: Okay, that's fair. You put in the deal, and I'll gladly accept. <eos> YOU: Alrighty.  Hope you have fun on your hiking!  Make sure you stay hydrated.  Going to push it through now. <eos> THEM: Sounds good, you have fun, too! And good luck cooking up all that food, chef! <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

I have a medical condition that burns more calories than a normal person so need more food <eos> YOU: Dang that's terrible. Sadly I'm going to need some food too as mine spoiled in my cooler  <eos> THEM: I also sweat like crazy so need replenishment.  So how about I get 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood <eos> YOU: How about 1 food, 1 firewood and 3 water? <eos> THEM: i really need the food!! how about 2 food and 2 firewood <eos> YOU: I don't need any water because there is a lake nearby. How about I take 1 food and 3 firewood then? <eos> THEM: and I get 2 food and 3 water <eos> YOU: Sure <eos> THEM: that sounds fair to me <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </partner_input>

I have my puppy with me, and wan to be sure he has plenty to drink. Why is it that you need the water and firewwod? <eos> THEM: I have kidney disease and need the extra water for the trip, I also love a good meal and love to cook over the fire. <eos> YOU: I am willing to give more of the firewood to make sure my puppy has enough to stay hydrated.  <eos> THEM: Wouldn't your puppy also need more of the food? <eos> YOU: We need a little extra food, but could easily share that.  <eos> THEM: Well I bring my own food, so would be willing to give you all of the extra.  <eos> YOU: I am most concerned about her hydration. He will be allowed to be more active because of the extra space, and since it is his first time I was unsure of how much he would need. I don't mind sharing the food , and if you had extra firewood, extra food would be great! <eos> THEM: I can make due with one water, and all of the firewood. You can have the extra two waters and the food. Should satisfy us both. <eos> YOU: That sounds great!

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hello!  Great to see you, here for a hike to the Lake? <eos> YOU: Yes but I am going to camping trip <eos> THEM: Yeah, I am camping also.  My wife and mother-in-law are down geting the site permit and trail maps.  I'm trying to sort out our supplies.  We flew in and the airline loss the bag with our sleeping bags and food. <eos> YOU: Oh so sorry to hear that. I am also in a need of supplies. I am mostly worried about water as I do get dehydrated easily and cannot function properly like that. What are your concerns? <eos> THEM: Well I see they have some extra supplies to split between the sites.  I really need food and firewood to help keep everyone happy.  <eos> YOU: I would be happy to give you the entire food supply if I can get all the water. But I would like a minimum of two firewood because I also get very cold and am afraid of dark - so would have to burn it all night long. I would be scared to run out. Ideally would like to have all of it but I understand that you would need some. <eos> THEM: Sounds good on the food and water, but my mother-in-law is going to give me a lot of grief if she sees a small pile of wood here.  Being that there is a fire pit between our sites can I convince you to let me have two of the wood and we can put on as much as we need to keep it going between us.   I really need points with my mother-in-law!  <eos> YOU: I am going with my fiancee and she would "kill" me if I cannot secure enough firewood. I think I cannot budge on this. She will probably already be upset that I did not get more firewood..  <eos> THEM: That sounds tough to deal with also.  How about you take the two wood but I get a water? <eos> YOU: Then I would need some food.  <eos> THEM: No that won't work.  I can survive with the 3 food for me, 3 water for you, and 2 firewood for you and 1 for me.  Shall we make that a deal? <eos> YOU: So you would get 3 food and 1 firewood, yes.  <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>

I'm plotting a backcountry camping trip with friends, so food is my top priority, with water as the second. What are your needs? <eos> YOU: That's funny because I am doing the same with the same priorities.  Funny world we live in .  I think we can come to a fair compromise though. <eos> THEM: Definetly. Would you be more flexible on food or water? I'm more flexible on having less water. I can usually find some that can be treated on the hike. <eos> YOU: As we have the same priorities, I have the same flexibility .  I am willing to forgo all the water if I can get at least one firewood.  I can figure out how to pack a camelbak full before I arrive. <eos> THEM: I'm looking to get 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood out of the deal. What would your offer be? <eos> YOU: I think that's fair.  I can take 1 food, 2 waters, and 2 firewood. <eos> THEM: I'm usually more flexible on firewood than I am anything else, as I have a small camp stove. I feel this way is the best, do you have any other ideas? <eos> YOU: I need to figure how to pack more food in my backpack now, but I think that's a deal that works for both of us. <eos> THEM: Ok, so let me get this right: I get 2 food, 1 water, 1 firewood. You get 1 food, 2 waters, 2 firewood? Does that look right? <eos> YOU: That is perfect for me. <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </partner_input>
<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hi there, I was thinking that I could have 3 Firewood, 3 Food, and you can have all of the water? I have a water supply nearby and dont need that but food is scarce and I need the firewood to cook throughout the day. <eos> YOU: Hello. This is no good for me. I do need a lot of water because I am bringing my dog Jedi with me. He drinks a lot when he's active. I will also need some firewood. How about I take all of the 2 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food?  <eos> THEM: I can understand the water for the dog, but I don't see why you would need 2 food and 1 firewood also. I have myself and my girlfriend and 2 kids going which is why I am more concerned for the food and heat. How many people are camping with you? <eos> YOU: Understood  I have two adults and a dog. How do you think things could be split equitably?  <eos> THEM: I feel that it would be reasonable, that I take the 3 firewood, 2 food, and no water. That leaves you with 3 water for you and your group, 1 food to split, and firewood you would have an easier time to collect than I would having to keep track of 2 toddlers in the woods.  <eos> YOU: I am excited to go camping. My arthritis doesn't seem to hurt as much when I'm communing with nature, but even as excited as I am, I cannot accept this deal. I would really like some food and firewood too. What if you get 1 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food?  <eos> THEM: I completely understand and know how the weather and nature can help with body pain but I cannot accept that deal. I have a girlfriend and 2 kids along with myself. That is 2 more people than you, which means I need more supplies. This is the first trip we have been able to take together as a family and I want to make it memorable for the kids especially. I feel it would be fair then if I got 2 firewood, 2 food, and 1 water then. It gives you a supply of each and more than enough water to last the trip for you and yours. <eos> YOU: That will be fun for your family. Are you sure you wouldn't consider giving me 2 firewood, 1 food, and 2 water? The heat from the fire would help my arthritis tremendously and it would add to my enjoyment of the camping experience.  <eos> THEM: I really would rather keep the firewood for my kids so that I can take the time to teach them the proper way to start fires and the safety of it all. I can negotiate on the others but the firewood I would really rather keep 2 for myself, and either 2 food for me and you can have all 3 waters or 2 wood, 1 food, and 1 water. Would either of those work for you? <eos> YOU: You do have more people to feed, and you definitely have to pack extra supplies for the children. How about I have 3 waters, 1 wood, and 1 food?  <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=3 item0=2 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>

What are your preferences on the items you need most? <eos> THEM: Well, last time we went camping my daughter got dehydrated so I would really like extra water. How about you? <eos> YOU: My priority would also be water as well as food. My wife is currently pregnant and it is required of her to drink plenty of water and eat food often. She is constantly thirsty and hungry. <eos> THEM: Yes, water is important. I agree. We are having some underprivileged kids staying with us also so we need extra food too for them. <eos> YOU: I totally understand! I'm afraid for how the weather will be and that my wife and unborn baby will need some more nourishment than usual <eos> THEM: What do you think is more important for her? Water or food if you had to choose? <eos> YOU: I believe that water would be the most important. The doctor is always pushing for her to drink more water. We don't have as many mouths to feed so I feel that we won't need as much food as you. <eos> THEM: Are you thinking that you might need more firewood also? Will it be chilly where you are? <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: Reject-Deal <eos> THEM: I can give you more water if I can have all the wood. <eos> YOU: It won't be very chilly where I am so you can have all the wood.

What's more important to you, food or water? <eos> THEM: I need more of food, but since it is what you need the most you should keep 2 of food. Water is what I need the least since I brought a lot <eos> YOU: I think we can work something out here.  How about I take 2 food, 2 water, and 0 firewood.  You take 1 food, 1 water, and 3 firewood? <eos> THEM: That sounds fair to me. Why don't you need wood? <eos> YOU: I'll be honest, it's hot out where I am.  I can collect enough dead wood in addition to our basic supplies for cooking and I really don't need a fire going at night.

I don't think that it's going to be that hot, and I don't really like drinking water. <eos> YOU: Hmm. I would be willing to trade you two packages of food for one water and one firewood. <eos> THEM: Do you mean that I would get 2 firewood, 2 food, and 2 firewood?? <eos> YOU: In exchange of two of my food packages for one of your waters and one of your foods, you would then have 5 foods, 2 waters, and 2 firewoods. <eos> THEM: That doesn't work.  There are only a total of 3 firewood, 3 food, and 3 water.  Can I have 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water? <eos> YOU: I suppose I misread the instructions, or they were not very clear, I had read them as we each had 3 packages each of the 3 items.  <eos> THEM: We each have basic camping supplies.  We need to split the additional 3 firewood, 3 food, and 3 water.  What supplies do you want the most? <eos> YOU: OK. I would much prefer the firewood. <eos> THEM: I also want firewood, but I'll give up some for additional food.

I can offer you two waters so that you are better hydrated and one food as well.  <eos> YOU: I would prefer 3 firewood. You can have 3 food and 1 water. <eos> THEM: I'm afraid that I cannot give all 3 firewood and would need at least one of them. I will offer one more water or food in addition.  <eos> YOU: I understand that you need 1 firewood. What was that for? <eos> THEM: I will need one firewood to keep my family warm while camping.  <eos> YOU: OH yes now I remember that.  <eos> THEM: And I understand the subzero temps will be hard to weather, which is why I would like to offer you two firewood.  <eos> YOU: I will accept the offer of 2 firewood, 1 food, and 2 water.   <eos> THEM: Okay, that is a deal.  <eos> YOU: Thank you. <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

I am going camping with my youth camp, 40 kids! lots of work on my end. I was wondering If its okay with you, if I can get all 3 waters? I am willing to give you all 3 of my Firewood? i really need the extra supplies for cooking, cleaning, and to compensate for the amount of water kids will be spilling. what are your thoughts? <eos> THEM: Wow, 40 kids.  Thats lot.  I decided to bring my family with me today including my grandmother, grandfather and young children.  I was hoping to at least get one water to make my baby some formula.  So I propose I take 1 water, 2 food and all firewood? <eos> YOU: its our annual youth camp, lots of fun but with a lot of work. Oh no! I completely understand your worries, as I will be having kids as young as 2 at the camp. I am willing to part with 2 foods and all firewood for all 3 waters. Not wanting to disregard your family, but my numbers truly need the extra supplies of water. specially with the amount of cooking I will be doing. We are camping for 15 days. May I ask how long you are camping for?  <eos> THEM: I completely understand, children are very important.  They are our future.  We are camping for 14 days.  I wanted to give my children/family the experience of living outdoors with out the technology and other distractions we typically have at home.  I am willing to agree to 2 foods, 3 firewood.  I believe it is fair for both of us <eos> YOU: I completely agree with you, different ages as well, required different needs. One thing I have learned camping, the more supplies you'll have the better off, you will be. just to confirm, I will be getting 3 waters, 1 food, and 0 FW.  <eos> THEM: Yes, I will be taking 2 foods and 3 Firewoods.  I hope you have amazing camping trip <eos> YOU: wishing you the same! where are you guys camping to? we are going to colorado!  <eos> THEM: We are going in Georgia! We are excited for our little family time.   <eos> YOU: Never been to Georgia, but I've heard its completely gorgeous down there, your family will truly have a treat. plus you wont have the worry of taking care of so many kids, kids that arent yours lol! so thankful for my volunteers who are coming with me. <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=1 item2=3 item0=3 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

I'm most hoping to come out of this with food because I'm a big, athletic guy and I get pretty hungry. <eos> YOU: I'm fine, thanks. I understand what you're saying, I'm a big guy too and also want to do a lot of hiking, so I might need extra food as well. <eos> THEM: We can probably split the food. What else are you looking for? <eos> YOU: Well, if I want to hike I might need more water. What's your take on extra water? <eos> THEM: I don't really get the thirsty so I don't need much water. I do need firewood though because I'm worried about my fire dying. <eos> YOU: Oh, I think we're reaching middle ground here. I really think I have enough firewood, you can have it all if you need it.  <eos> THEM: Okay great! So how about you get all the water, I get all the firewood, and we split the food? <eos> YOU: Yeah, I agree. One thing, how do we split the food? <eos> THEM: How about I get 2 and you get 1? <eos> YOU: I agree but, in that case, can I take 1 of the firewood packages? It'd be 2 food packages and 2 firewood packages for you. <eos> THEM: Sure, that sounds good to me! <eos> YOU: I think we have a deal! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=3 item0=2 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

What resources do you need? <eos> YOU: I'm in need of firewood. It's a family tradition to tell stories around the campfire, so I want to be sure we're well stocked for the weekend. <eos> THEM: That sounds like a very cool tradition. Would you be good with two firewood and 1 each of water and food? <eos> YOU: That sounds reasonable, but I'm hoping I'd be able to get 2 food instead of 1. I've got two young kids who eat A LOT, so I want to make sure they're well fed and in good moods  <eos> THEM: I'm a bodybuilder so that extra food is kinda essential sorry.  <eos> YOU: I totally understand. If that's the case, though, I think I'll need 3 firewood to ensure I can keep them occupied with stories when they get hungry. <eos> THEM: You can have three firewood if I get three water and two food. I'm giving you the top item so i think I should get some concessions.  <eos> YOU: I appreciate that. However, I will need at least 1 water. You're already getting the majority of the food, and you're welcome to the majority of the water as well. I do need to keep the kids hydrated though  <eos> THEM: <selection>YOU: Reject-Deal <eos>  </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

What are you most interested in? <eos> YOU: I believe that I need most of the food because I eat a lot to begin with but everything else is negotiable <eos> THEM: OK makes sense. You can have all the food, but I'll need 3 water and 2 firewood <eos> YOU: I think I need water also, you know, just in case. What about 1 water and you can have all the fire wood   <eos> THEM: OK I can do that <eos> YOU: Alright, so your going have 3 firewood and 2 water and I get the rest.

I'll try and help out. <eos> YOU: Great!  Since there's a pile of extra supplies here, is there something that'd make your camping trip go really well that we could make a bargain about? <eos> THEM: Well we plan to do quite a bit of hiking, so some extra water would be awesome. <eos> YOU: Sure.  Well, I do like to make coffee in the mornings too but if we could maybe let me take most of the spare food I could spare you the water. <eos> THEM: That sounds fair. You must have a good appetite then? <eos> YOU: Well, my family's always said that if you can't get your energy from coffee, a hearty meal in the morning can be just as good. <eos> THEM: Haha. Alright so you can take all the firewood, I'll take the water, and you can have two of the food. You got a little bit better deal but that's ok. <eos> YOU: It's a bit of a tradeoff because of the water, but I think we both deserve a good camping trip here.  <eos> THEM: You can visit our site and have some coffee with us before we head out hiking. <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=2 item2=0 item0=0 item1=1 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>
<input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hello, I would like to get some firewood for my camping, some extra water because I only consume water as my drink, and I have some extra people to feed so I would like some extra food. <eos> YOU: Hello Firewood is all yours because I can obtain more throughout the campsite if need be. I would need extra water because I also only consume water. I would also need food for myself, because I do not need to feed extra people. I will be riding this one out by myself <eos> THEM: Great! I will take the firewood for sure. <eos> YOU: Would you agree to me getting 2 Water/ 2 Food/ 0 Firewood and you would get 1 Water/ 1 Food/ 3 Firewood? <eos> THEM: I think that would work for me. I do really need the firewood since I seem to always be cold. :) I am okay with the other proposal as to the food. I am not sure about the water yet just because I don't know if I would need more than you are offering <eos> YOU: Well thanks for your consideration, that seemed to work out.   I would still need some water for my dog who always goes camping with me. He helps me out with hunting and finding my way around when hiking and he will also be my only company. I would hate to have to leave him behind due to lack of water or food. How can we resolve this?? <eos> THEM: Yeah, dogs are great companions and I know how much they want to be with their people and obviously, you would want them to be around. I guess you would need the water more than I would at this time since your dog would be coming along with you. <eos> YOU: Wow Thank You so much for your consideration and for being so understanding. I really appreciate that. So are we agreeing to the original offer shown above? YOU: 3 Firewood/ 1 Food/ 1 Water and ME: 0 Firewood/ 2 Food/ 2 Water? <eos> THEM: Yes, that does work for me. I will be willing to accept the 3 Firewood, 1 Water, and 1 Food. You will get the 0 Firewood, 2 Water, and 2 Food. Plus, I would like to meet your lovely dog  <eos> YOU: Well that is just great! I am so happy that we were able to work this out. And yes my lovely dog Rex is always willing to make new friends like you! It has been great to be able to chat and work this out with you, we will look forward to seeing you at camp <eos> THEM: Awesome! Looking forward to seeing both of you there!

I plan on hiking a lot, so I'll need to refuel. What about you? <eos> YOU: Water is most important to me. However, food is a close second. <eos> THEM: Water is a close second for me, so we have different specific needs.  <eos> YOU: Yes. Have you considered how useful water may be to you if food is your highest priority?  <eos> THEM: Water is a bit useful, but food is the priority. Is food going to be a priority to you? <eos> YOU: Yes it is. Firewood should be higher on your list since food is the most important to you. You need to be able to cook <eos> THEM: Water is second because we plan to hike, so the food would be packages that don't necessarily need a lot of firewood. We also plan to sleep early.  <eos> YOU: Yes but how will you stay warm in the night? It may also scare away predators in the night time. <eos> THEM: We will have plenty of blankets and a nice tent with sleeping bags.  <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: Reject-Deal <eos> YOU: Reject-Deal <eos> YOU: I would like to have 2 packages of firewood but the rest of the deal is agreeable. <eos> THEM: I will do that if I get 1 extra package of food.  <eos> YOU: That leaves me with none. <eos> THEM: You get 2 waters and 2 firewoods.  <eos>  </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </partner_input>

I could trade some for some water. <eos> THEM: Here's the problem.  I'll build and tend the fire but I'll need two packages to do that.  But I'll only need one water package.   <eos> YOU: I don't really need that much water either, but I need extra firewood because I'm anemic and alway feel cold. Do you have extra food I could trade as well? <eos> THEM: Oh, wow.  You're anemic.  I'm diabetic so I need to eat frequently so that I don't have a low blood sugar episode.  I can exchange give you one food package, two firewoods and one water. <eos> YOU: That sounds perfect  I'm also hoping to make some smores with the grandkids one night.

I would be happy to let you have 2 of 3 food packages, I'm trying not to over do it on food <eos> THEM: Well we do need food for the animals.  Could we also get one of the waters then? <eos> YOU: I do really need the water. What if you took all 3 of the food packages and 2 of the firewood? <eos> THEM: I would really want all 3 firewood if I'm not getting any water.  How important is the water to you? <eos> YOU: The water is the highest priority for me, but I would also like just one firewood package so I can make sure my group keeps warm tonight <eos> THEM: How about we take 1 water, 2 firewood and 3 food? <eos> YOU: Hmm, I'm afraid I can't agree to that.

I don't really need food, i am good at foraging  <eos> THEM: That works for me, but I also need to keep a lot of water so how about I keep 2 food and 2 water and you get all the firewood? <eos> YOU: So I would get all the firewood, one water and one food?

How about 2 water for you and 1 for me, 2 food for me/1 for you, 2 firewood for me and 1 for you?  <eos> YOU: I completely agree with you about the water and the firewood but I have a few kids with me who are just bottomless pits  and could really use 2 foods for me and 1 food for you <eos> THEM: Dont want the kids to go hungr  But I do need to eat some too.  How about you take the 3 water  and while we keep the food and wood as first proposed? <eos> YOU: Hungry kids are not happy kids.  I can see that you are really in need of some additional food.  Are you by yourself? <eos> THEM: No, my wife and mother inlaw are down at the ranger station getting a trail map.   <eos> YOU: Nice family vacation  I think the kids should be fine for one night.

Then you would have six items and I would have three, and I'm not getting enough food for my trip. What do you think of my offer of two food and three firewood for me, and 3 water and 1 food for you. That way you have enough food and water for your diabetic concerns.  <eos> YOU: Ill settle with 3 water and 2 food and then you can have have 1 food and 3 firewood.

You can have the extra water since that's more useful after camping if it's not used up. <eos> YOU: I have already got alot of water, I need food the most as I need it to survive <eos> THEM: Well, we have enough food to survive. This is just extra. <eos> YOU: ok, in that case can I get 3 food, 2 firewood and 0 water? <eos> THEM: What I'm saying is that we each should have enough of the basic stuff and the rest is extra. <eos> YOU: ok, so lets split it in the middle, I will get 2 food, 1 firewood and 1 water, actually u are getting more as you will be getting 5 items <eos> THEM: Ok I'm fine with that. That's fair. <eos> YOU: ok <eos> THEM: Just to confirm: 1 food for me, 2 firewood for me, and 2 waters for me.

I would be willing to give up the water <eos> YOU: I cannot give up all the food. I am diabetic and have to worry about my blood sugar. I would be willing to give you 1 of the boxes of extra food and 2 of the firewood and 2 of the water. <eos> THEM: Although, I sympathize with the condition. I won't have enough food and would be really needing the food more than the water. Can I maybe take 2 foods? <eos> YOU: I really don't want to budge on the issue, if my blood sugar gets low I will desperately need the extra. In my experience camping, if I start having issues I need something on hand. Do y'all plan to fish or pick berries while camping? That could possibly supplement the extra food for the boys and it would give them a fun activity to do.  <eos> THEM: Well that could be fun for you too. You have the basic supplies already so I would think that you just need a supplemental food  <eos> YOU: You also have the basic supplies. I enjoy bird watching and just relaxing when I go camping. I am no longer able to hike or do much physical activity due to my health and age. I would prefer to have the food on hand. It could be a matter of life or death, especially since I camp on my own. <eos> THEM: I am going to be respectful and not argue here as they are the rules, you have an agreement. I will say you are comparing yourself to 3 people  <eos> YOU: Thank you, I appreciate you being respectful of my health. <eos> THEM: yup, so the agreement is 1 box food for myself, 2 firewood and 2 water. thank you <eos> YOU: yes, that is the agreement <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

What do you prefer? <eos> YOU: Water is also important to me, but I think that a large amount of firewood and food could also benefit me as well. <eos> THEM: I see. I don't need firewood that much. Would you like to take all of it so I can get more of the food and water? <eos> YOU: I would still need a bit of food, but yes the firewood would help me <eos> THEM:  Great! Take all the firewood then. Then I'll take a greater share of the food and water. <eos> YOU: No, I will still need more food.  <eos> THEM: You drive a hard bargain.  <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

I believe i presented the best offer. <eos> THEM: That's not too great for me. would you be willing to swap some food for firewood? <eos> YOU: Are you ready to give up the one food so that i can give up he 1 firewood for you? <eos> THEM: The offer you gave leaves me with no food currently. <eos> YOU: That is what i am saying. I can then take 2 food 2 water and 1 firewood. That is my best offer. <eos> THEM: How about this. you get 3 Water, 0 Food, and 2 firewood. That leaves me with 0 Water, 3 Food, and 1 Firewood. Not perfect, but leaves us both equally unhappy  <eos> YOU: No. I really need that food more than any thing else. Your first offer was better.

Why do you need so much food? <eos> THEM: How is it not fair? It's three of each for both of us. You wanted 6 of the 9 items. I need the food because I am diabetic and low blood sugar can kill me. <eos> YOU:  I also need some food to feed my children. How about if I get two food, and two waters. That will give you one of each. <eos> THEM: Absolutely not. How do you think that's fair? I'll take two food, two firewood and you can have the rest. <eos> YOU: I was only speaking of food and water. I hadn't discussed firewood. I really don't need any since it's so hot out. But with 5 children I'm not sure if one package of food will be enoguh. <eos> THEM: I tried to be patient. My offer is 2 food, 2 firewood, and you can have the rest. That leaves you with 5 items and I only get 4. You can accept this, or I will walk away. <eos> YOU:  <eos> THEM: Do you agree?

I am requesting 3 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood. I know this is a big request, but the need is great. Would you be so kind as to accept this request? <eos> THEM: Hi, I'm afraid I am also in dire need of them as well. I am open to negotiating, but will need a much fairer split than 3, 2, 2. I propose 2 food for myself, 3 firewood, and 1 water <eos> YOU: You say fair, but that strikes me as a rather uneven split. What is your #1 need? <eos> THEM: I need Food the most, and you? <eos> YOU: I too need food most. If you have 2 food, that would leave me with only one of my most needed resource. I could possibly make this work, but then I would need 3 water and 2 firewood.  <eos> THEM: I think the fairest would be a 5/4 split as there are 9 resources. Why don't you take 2 food and 2 water. I will take 1 food, 3 firewood, and 1 water?  <eos> YOU: Yes, agree to the first point. What is your second most needed resource? <eos> THEM: Firewood. I assume yours is water. Thus if you get 2 of each of your top 2, I'll need 1 and 3, with the tie break being 1 remaining of least desireable to make it fair <eos> YOU: I think we can make that work. If you agree, let's submit the deal. I need to go to the doctor soon to get a boil lanced. <eos> THEM: OK, sounds good.

I can also spare you some things and I also need you to compensate by sparing some other things that will make our trip to be excited. <eos> YOU: What are the kind of things that you need? <eos> THEM: I thought that I will get woods in the camping area by cutting small branches of trees, but due to rain all trees are wet and it will not be used for firing.   <eos> YOU: OK how about we share. If you could spare 2 wood for me you can keep 1. Also 2 foods for me and one for you.  I will not need too much water so you can have 2 and I will have one.

I understand why you need the food now. Since we wouldn't have to hike an hour to the stream to get water, we'll probably be less hungry then.

I'm mostly packed. You? <eos> THEM: Yes, I am.  Just a few last minute errands and we will be ready to go.  Who is joining you on your trip or are you going solo? <eos> YOU: Well, it was going to be a solo trip, but at the last minute my friend asked if he could join. I want to say yes but I don't think I have enough food for another person. When we split up supplies, how about I take all of the food and half the firewood, and you take the water and the rest of the firewood? <eos> THEM: How about I take 3 firewoods and 2 waters and you can have all the food?  <eos> YOU: Hm, that doesn't work for me. I get really cold, so I'm looking forward to building a big fire. How about I take all the food, 1 firewood, and 1 water, and you take 2 firewoods and 2 waters? <eos> THEM: I agree a fire at night is really nice. I think this deal is pretty good. I think we have food covered as my sons went to the store today and picked up all of their favorite snacks.  Not sure it's all going to fit in my car. LOL <eos> YOU: Nice! I'll tell my friend he can join - he'll be so excited  <eos> THEM: I think it is always a good idea to go with someone else not only for companionship but also for safety.  Are  you planning on hiking? I heard it is beautiful this time of year.  <eos> YOU: That's a good point about safety. Yes, I'm going to do some day hikes. How about you and your boys? <eos> THEM: Yes hiking and some fishing too.  <eos> YOU: That sounds great!

They're really not big eaters.  A couple of them always seem to be cold so some more firewood would be great. <eos> YOU: We could help with that I'm sure. What about 3 food for me, 3 water for you, and 2 firewood for you with just 1 for me? <eos> THEM: That would be great. Very nice of you. <eos> YOU: Great some have a deal. Are you looking forward to camping? <eos> THEM: Been looking forward to this trip for a long time.  I just wasn't sure about the supplies.  You have helped ease my mind.  <eos> YOU: Glad Imcou <eos> THEM: So it's agreed, 3 water for me, 3 food for you and 2 firewood for me and 1 for you? <eos> YOU: Sounds great.

I was actually trying to get 3 food, 3 firewood and 3 water...my kids have been looking forward to this camping trip for such a long time, and I want to make sure everything goes smoothly. <eos> THEM: I understand but that would mean you get everything and i get nothing. How is that fair?  <eos> YOU: That's true. Can I get 3 food, 2 water? And you can have 2 firewood? <eos> THEM: I like to have a nice cup of tea at night before I go to bed to help me relax and sleep. I also need food to eat. You never know if you are going to get stranded and so I would like some extra food <eos> YOU: Absolutely, that sounds like a real concern. How about we do 2 for 1? I just am really concerned for my kids, I have so many people accompanying me on this trip. <eos> THEM: Ok I am willing to make it so we both win and have a great time.  I guess since you are having more people it would make sense to need more food.  <eos> YOU: I agree, and I really appreciate it. So 2-1 straight down? I'll submit the deal. <eos> THEM: Sure only so your kids can have a great time and its just me going camping.  <eos> YOU: Sounds good. Thanks from all of us, I really appreciate it--and so do they. It's going to be a pretty cool time together. The youth deserve the outdoors. They're our future. <eos> THEM:  enjoy your time. Kids grow up so fast.

I am bringing teenagers with me, so I was hoping to have all three food and at least two water. <eos> THEM:  Ill need at least two food, I am a diabetic and food and water are essential to keep my blood sugar within a range that I will be able to function, without it my mental status changes, and unless those teens want to see an interestingggg show I need food and water <eos> YOU: Understood. How many people will be with you? <eos> THEM: We are a family of 3, and have 2 dogs, the dogs will not require food from this package, but will need someof the water <eos> YOU: We are also a family of 3 . But my son is bringing three friends. Have you ever fed four teenage boys?  Lord help me! That is why I was hoping to have more food. <eos> THEM: I can't even imagine! What if we do you can have two food, 1 water and since I have the dogs that love to run and play, Ill take 1 food and 2 water <eos> YOU: That sounds great! How would you like to split the firewood? My son loves to build campfires. <eos> THEM: With taking less food my sugar will be low, in that state I will be very cold. My wife knows when my sugar is dropping just based on how many blankets I need, even in the summer haha!  <eos> YOU: Would you like all three then? My son and his friends can gather sticks and broken pieces in the woods. <eos> THEM: Sounds like a great compromise!

I didn't realize that I would have a neighbor so close <eos> THEM: Well, hopefully since we are close neighbors we can work out an agreement that helps us both, right? <eos> YOU: yup!  I am a master chef.  I think that if we pool our resources everything will be great for both of us <eos> THEM: That would be great! Since you are a master chef, you can probably make something out of nothing like a true pro! Unfortunately, I am a diabetic and if I don't eat regularly my blood sugar drops and I get really dizzy and could even pass out. I would be much more comfortable knowing the 3 food packs were with me so they are close if I need them. Is that okay with you? <eos> YOU: Yes.  I have no problem with that.  Keep your firewood over at my site and just tell me when you need something made.  That way you don't need to worry about cooking while your sugar is low <eos> THEM: Wow, that would be so kind of you  You can take the 3 firewood and I will take the 3 food. Are you okay with me taking the water as well? <eos> YOU: leave me with one so that the kids have easy access to water.  wood with me, food with you, and 1 water with me <eos> THEM: That works for me. 3 firewood and 1 water to you, 3 food and 2 water for me.

In regards to the triip and supplies you are hoping to procure; what is your priorities?  <eos> YOU: Well it is by fresh water so I would say water is the lowest. But I am not sure about what would is there so firewood? What about you? <eos> THEM: I agree that lake michigan and winnebago has access to water to boil, fish to catch, and I think firewood to chop. I would say that for the camping trip food would be the highest want followed by firewood and finally water <eos> YOU: I can understand that. I went on a winter trip that was like that. So how would you like to trade items? <eos> THEM: Would you be interested in trade 2 Water for 1 Firewood and 2 Firewood for 1 Food? <eos> YOU: Yes that sounds alright to me.

I need water as well for my camping trip and would like more food as well.  <eos> THEM: I can understand, but I need water and food for my camping trip, and sure I need firewood as well <eos> YOU: Okay, I understand. How about this new deal since it seems you want more water than me I will comprise and give you more water than me as long as you give me more food. I will also compromise on firewood as well and give you more. So basically it would look like for me: 3 food, 1 firewood, 1 water. And for you it would be 1 food, 2 firewood, 2 water <eos> THEM: I can't accept the deal! I'm sorry!  I can compromise with water for you and firewood but not with food, so I goes like 2 water 2 food and 1 firewood for me and 1 water 1 food and 2 firewood for you <eos> YOU: So you're willing to compromise on water and firewood?

We have non-persihable food stored at our camp site so we don't need to bring additional food but water and some firewood are important to avoid running out of water or the means to boil water from a stream if needed. <eos> THEM: Okay. I am in need of additional food as I am a diabetic. Water isnt really a priority to me.

I also need water, but since I'm going to be moving around a lot, food is my highest concern. It sounds like neither one of us will be too concerned about firewood. <eos> THEM: I am wanting to build a fire, to be able to cook on. Since I will be on the river, I will have some water. What about If I had 2 of the firewood and the food. What if you have all the water and one food? <eos> YOU: Well, I'm glad you plan to build a fire! I don't, so I'd be willing to let you have all 3 firewood. I need some of the food as well. How about you take all 3 firewood, and I get 2 food and 3 water (you will have extra water, after all)? <eos> THEM: That is true. I would need some food, since I will not have any water. What if I have the 3 firewood and 2 food. That way you have the water so you will not be parched and you will have a food as well.  <eos> YOU: I think we're close to an agreement here!  Given that I plan to be very active, I'd still like to keep 2 of the food if I can. If I give up one water (who knows what you'll need, and the river won't be for drinking!), could we do a deal where I get 2 food and 2 water and you get all 3 firewood and 1 food and 1 water? Maybe you could catch some fish (if I do, I could share)? <eos> THEM: That is a great agreement! I would be happy with the 3 firewood, 1 food and one water.

You can take the water <eos> THEM: It's a good thing we already have firewood already! But I can imagine that keeping the little ones warm is a hard task. I'm in need of firewood because we got caught in a storm and our clothes are soaking wet. Would you accept 1 firewood and 2 food? <eos> YOU: I actually need the extra firewood. Remember kids are more susceptible to cold. They need it to stay warm when it's cold.  <eos> THEM: I'm aware that kids need to stay warm when it's cold. Do you know how cold it is when all your clothes are soaking wet from the rain? I'm sure you can spare at least one firewood so we can dry off.  <eos> YOU: If that's the case then, let me have 2 firewood, you can keep the water. I need more food for my kids as well. You know how much kids eat.  <eos> THEM: Kids definitely eat a lot. I'm sure kids also love S'mores. If you give me one food as well, I'll be more than happy to invite you and the kids to the S'mores party we're having later on!  <eos> YOU: Wow... That's interesting. I will definitely bring them to the party.  <eos> THEM: Great!  I'll be happy to see you all there. To confirm, I'm giving you 2 firewood and 2 food, and I'll give 1 firewood, 1 food, and all the waters? <eos> YOU: Yeah. It looks great. But it would be nice of you to share at least 1 water with me. That would be generous of you and my kids will appreciate your kind gesture.  <eos> THEM: Of course, I'll be more than happy to spare one water for the kids. <eos> YOU: Thanks a lot for that.

I can give 3 food for you and your kids.  <eos> YOU: I'll accept the food from you but I need at least 1 pack of water.Because water is very essential. We do not have sufficient water.Kindly share water with me. <eos> THEM: Ok I will give you 1 pack of water 1 firewood and 3 foods.  How does that sounds? <eos> YOU: You are so understandable.  I know we both need water in a high amount. I'll accept the water pack. In a trip, we need firewood for night. Can you share 2 firewood.? <eos> THEM: That is not very fair to me at. I'm trying to be fair to both of us.  <eos> YOU:  I can understand but I need firewood. You take 1 pack of food. Instead of 3 pack of food I will take 2 food and share 2 firewood. <eos> THEM: No way that is not fair at all.  You can get 2 waters 1 firewood and one food. That is fair and works out better for you. <eos> YOU: Okay.My intention is not making you tensed. I'll accept this one. 2 pack of water 1 pack of food and 1 pack of firewood. <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

Certainly will be better if we can find a compromise that suits us both.   <eos> YOU: What are you looking for? <eos> THEM: Food is most important to me. I am considering doing some extra hiking if I have the energy, i.e. calories, available.  <eos> YOU: OK, I am really looking for firewood as it has been very cold out and I am hunting for some food also. <eos> THEM: Would you be okay if I took 2 out of the 3 packages of food?  We can give you more firewood to compensate.  <eos> YOU: How is your water situation? There is a lot of fresh water around so I can part with a lot of my supply. <eos> THEM: I'll be happy to take whatever you can spare, but it is not a priority of mine, given the local supply you mentioned.   <eos> YOU: How much firewood is available. I would prefer 3 packages if I am giving up 2 food packages. <eos> THEM: Could you possibly leave me with one package of firewood?  I might want to stay up late and sing songs around the fire.   <eos> YOU: I would give you all the water if I could have all firewood. I would keep 1 food and give you two. <eos> THEM: Alright, I think that sounds pretty fair.  All our needs would be met.   <eos> YOU: You can cut down some trees for your fire haha. <eos> THEM: Maybe I'll just bring a pair of night vision goggles.   <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>
<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hello, I'm very excited for my trip, how about you? <eos> YOU: Hello! I'm just packing up now, just waiting for some extra stuff and I'll be ready! <eos> THEM: Awesome, I'm going to have a larger group with me, I would really appreciate getting the extra food, you are welcome to any amount of the wood and water. <eos> YOU: I'd be willing to give you all three food in exchange for what I need. I need water and firewood. I'll be camping in the desert and there's no water supply and it gets quite cold at night! <eos> THEM: Great, I would need a little extra water though for a larger group. Would 3 food, no wood and 1 water for me work for you? <eos> YOU: Hmm. I'd be more willing to give up some firewood than water. Would you take 1 firewood instead? <eos> THEM: Sure, I could do that. So 3 food, 1 fire and 0 water for me, the rest for you. <eos> YOU: That sounds good to me! <eos> THEM: great, looks like we are all set, enjoy your trip! <eos> YOU: You too! I'm glad we were able to make a deal <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>
<input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </input> <dialogue> YOU: Hi. I am pretty excited to take my son and his friends camping. They have so much energy <eos> THEM: Hey, I am also going camping but I am taking my 3 kids  <eos> YOU: Between us we have our hands full. So I am hoping to be able to score 3 food units and 2 waters. What are your needs? <eos> THEM: I can work with that but is there any way I can get 2 waters instead of just 1? There's nowhere to shower here <eos> YOU: Oh sure! I am okay with a jump in the river if it is not too cold! I need at least one firewood because I love to sew before bed but I need the light! <eos> THEM: That is fine. I can give up 1 firewood. Any way I can get 1 food? <eos> YOU: We really do need food because teens. But how about I give you 1 food and 1 firewood? Oh. That's what you just said! Great minds think alike. <eos> THEM: I'll just take 2 firewood 2 water if that's OK <eos> YOU: Oh well, I guess so.  I will probably fall asleep early anyway.  When are you leaving for your camp adventure? <eos> THEM: In about 30 minutes actually. Gotta get going so we can get there before noon <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>
<input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </input> <dialogue> THEM: I think I need more water because I take medicine and it gives me dry mouth. So I think I should have 2 more waters, 2 more food packages and 2 more firewoods. I'm not the best at camping. And I need all the help I can get. <eos> YOU: Hello! I totally get it. But, since my nephew will be joinging me on this trip, I won't be able to spar that much. <eos> THEM: I completely understand. But since you're taking your nephew, you must be confident in this camping trip. Whereas I am not. I'm new to this. So I really do need those supplies. I don't know how to hunt or fish. I'm sure you'll understand. <eos> YOU: I am a bit used to camping and that is why i prefer to bring extra food for two. Just in case the wildlife there isn't abudant. <eos> THEM: That's a good idea.  So since you already have extra I think my offer is pretty good. <eos> YOU: Okay, how about this. You get 3 firewood, 2 water. I get alll food, 1 water? <eos> THEM: That actually sounds pretty good all but the water. I need that extra water. So how about I agree to 2 firewoods, I''ll take you up on all the food since that may be a problem for me but I still need all of the waters. <eos> YOU: Thats sound fine <eos> THEM: Ok. Great. So just to verify I'll have 3 waters, 2 firewoods and 3 food packages.  <eos> YOU: Nope. I get the 3 food items. <eos> THEM: Yes that's right. sorry about that. you get 3 foods and 1 firewood. and i get 3 waters and 2 firewoods.  <eos> YOU: Yep, that's it. <eos> THEM: Glad that's settled. Hope you all have a good trip.  <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>
