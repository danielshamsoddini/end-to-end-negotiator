<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , how are you ? i was wondering if i can get all 3 firewood ? i am taking over 20 members with me , lots of bonfires happening , plus its the summer , bugs will be ready to attack lol , if thats okay with you ? what do you think ? <eos> THEM: i am good , thanks for asking i also need firewood , as we will be tent camping and have cool evenings in the desert . my greatest need is water , however . i could part with two firewood packages if you can give me all the water and 2 food packages . <eos> YOU: sounds like a fun trip ! would you compromise ? we are staying by a river , we can purify our water , would you be okay if i get all 3 firewoods and you'll get all 3 waters ? will that be okay with you ? <eos> THEM: i could do that if you can give me all the food . without the extra firewood , we will have to use all we have now for warmth in the evening , and will not have enough to cook with . thus , we would need to bring more prepared food and food that does not need to be cooked . <eos> YOU: i completely understand your concerns . i do believe its an unfair trade , i will only have 3 firewoods and 0 foods , and 0 waters . i have a large group , i need to have at least one food . what do you think , i do appreciate you working with me . <eos> THEM: i see what you mean . . . i can settle for 2 foods packages instead of 3 . <eos> YOU: thank you ! taking alot of kiddos with me , they are little rascals , they eat everything onsite . on my end i will be getting 3 firewoods , 1 food , and 0 waters . <eos> THEM: you are welcome . . . it sounds like we are ready to finalize ? <eos> YOU: yes , we are , i do believe we need to have 10 conversations before we can submit ? <eos> THEM: that is correct . just to confirm , we have agreed that you will take three firewood and and 1 food - - i will take three water and 2 food . <eos> YOU: yes , submitting deal on my end ! hope we get to work in the future again , have a wonderful day . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>
