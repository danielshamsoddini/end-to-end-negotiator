<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hey neighbor . i bet you're looking forward to your camping trip , as am i ! looks like we should divide up the remaining supplies between us . what's most important to you ? <eos> YOU: yeah ! i am ok with that , we can divide the remaining supplies between us . <eos> THEM: well let's start with food first . food's pretty important to me , since i'll be camping in a remote area without much access to food . how would you feel about letting me have all 3 of those ? <eos> YOU: food is very important for me too , for me to survive over there i would need food too . i would give you half of it . <eos> THEM: hmm food seems important to both of us . how do you feel about firewood and water ? <eos> YOU: there is a saying that water does not have enemy . i would need water for domestic use and i would need firewood in other to keep myself warm and as a source of energy in the night . <eos> THEM: ah then it sounds like we want all of the same things then , but we must sacrifice something for the good of everyone . what is more of a priority for you , firewood or food ? <eos> YOU: both are very important to me , but i would likely go for food , food is more important <eos> THEM: understood completely . i'm interested in food more than firewood as well . how would you feel if i took 2 food , 1 firewood , and all 3 waters ? <eos> YOU: the food you took is much , please take 1 food , 2 firewood and 2 water <eos> THEM: i think food is the tricky one here . how about this: you take all the firewood , and i'll take all the water . would you be willing to let me have 2 food then ? <eos> YOU: take 1 food , you take all the firewood and 1 water . let's do it like that <eos> THEM: that's a non - starter unfortunately . i'd be willing to let you have 2 food if you give me 1 firewood . you get 2 food and 2 firewood , and i get what's left . <eos> YOU: i think i am ok with the 2 food and the 1 firewood . you can get what is left . thank you <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=0 item0=1 item1=1 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>
<input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello ! i would like to have all three extra water packages . i have medication i need to take while camping and i would need the water to take the pills properly . <eos> THEM: hi there ! i hope you're having a good day . my top priority is firewood . i was hoping to have all three bundles if possible , as i'm going camping in the mountains . i'm more than happy to let you have extra water . what is your second priority ? <eos> YOU: i'm ok with letting go of two extra bundles of the firewood , if you'd be willing to let me have just one of them ? <eos> THEM: are you willing to bend on that at all ? i could let you have 2 water and 2 food in exchange for me getting all three extra firewood . i'm flexible though . <eos> YOU: ok after thinking i'd be willing to give you all 3 firewood if i can have all three water and 2 food . i don't know how to fish or hunt so the food package may help me more than the firewood as well . <eos> THEM: certainly ! i actually do know how to fish or hunt . i know i can make do with just one pack of food . i've had survival training as well . <eos> YOU: ok that's great ! <eos> THEM: so let's just review this before we agree on things . you get 0 firewood , 3 water , and 2 food . i get 3 firewood , 0 water , and 1 food for our respective trips . is that what you want me to offer ? <eos> YOU: yes , i was just going to confirm this as well . me = 0 firewood , 3 water , and 2 food . you = 3 firewood , 0 water , and 1 food . i agree to this if you do as well . <eos> THEM: that sounds perfect . i'll make sure to offer that then . thanks for your help . <eos> YOU: sounds good ! thank you as well . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>
