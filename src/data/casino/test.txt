" can you clarify ? <eos> YOU: what i mean by prevention of excess is that we should focus on getting excess and not to limit it regardless of what we already have because if we should offer some creative approaches by excess . we can both come to an agreement if you are interested . <eos> THEM: okay . lets just try to do some negotiation . i am the most interested in getting more water . the water i already have at the campsite looks dirty so , if it is okay with you , i would like all three of them . my food has also been stolen by bears and i don't make much left , so i would like two of the food items . you can have all the firewood and the other food item . how does that sound ? <eos> YOU: sound good enough but since you know i can not do without having anything to sustain me whenever i am thirsty then i suggest you are free to take two of the water and since your food has also been stolen by bears and you don't make much left , then you can have the two of the food items too and leave the three firewood for me with one food . how does that sound ? <eos> THEM: i think we are getting very close to a good deal . would you be willing to give me one firewood in case the stuff i have gets wet ? <eos> YOU: i strongly agree and shall we call it a deal now ? <eos> THEM: like i said , we are close but i really would feel better with just one of the firewood . i'm afraid of not being able to build a fire . if you really need the firewood , however , then i would take one additional item of either the water or food instead . <eos> YOU: and like i said , i strongly agree and you can have one firewood now . deal close ? <eos> THEM: yes . i think this is a fair deal . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi , how would you best describe your party needs ? <eos> THEM: hi ! i could really use some water . i'm very concerned about my kids getting dehydrated . one of my kiddos really struggles with it . i could really use 3 extra waters . <eos> YOU: i cannot spare a single water . i need all three waters because we have our grandparents who struggle with rheumatoid arthritis ; they could die if they have no water . could you give us all 3 of your waters ? <eos> THEM: wow , that's asking a lot . for me to give you all 3 would be risky for me . the only way i would consider it is if you could give me all of the firewood and food . at least if i had extra firewood i could boil water out in the wild to help make up for the water i'm missing . <eos> YOU: agreed to the firewood . we are at an impasse on the food situation . our party also has a large number of folks , so we will need at least 2 foods . if we are giving you all our firewood , then we will need 3 foods because we will be unable to cook . i believe your children should be alright as long as your food satisfies their dietary needs . <eos> THEM: i don't know that i could give you all the food . what about i get 1 water , 3 firewoods , and 1 food ? <eos> YOU: you will need to give us all of your water for this amount of firewood and food . <eos> THEM: i will give you 3 waters , if you give me 3 firewoods and 2 foods . <eos> YOU: i will give you 3 firewoods and 1 food if you give me 3 waters . <eos> THEM: okay , i can make that work . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hy thats my offer <eos> THEM: hi there . . i'm sorry , i didn't see your offer as it doesn't show it for 10 messages , i believe . so , here's the situation . . i think i can get by with less firewood as i'm a floridian and prefer it cooler anyway . . also the food is not a huge thing for me as we can catch / improvise around the campsite - but i'm definitely interested in as much water as possible . . both for cooking and cleaning purposes , as well as drinking , of course . <eos> YOU: okay so what do you suggest <eos> THEM: well , i recognize you're gonna need water too . . so i'd love to take 2 of them , giving you one and i'm totally ok with going 1 on the firewood and one on the food . . that way we all ensure we have enough . . you're making out a bit better in quantity that way but i think its best for both of us <eos> YOU: i botttle of water for a can of food and 2 firewoods <eos> THEM: yeah , sorry , that's not going to work out for me . i'm going to need at least 2 bottles of water , 1 food packet , and one firewood . . again , this does leave you with two each on the food and the firewood , which are both very important things for this camping trip ! <eos> YOU: but thats the only offer im willing to give <eos> THEM: well then unfortunately i think we're gonna have to walk away from this and neither of us gets anything we could both use . . that's unfortunate and i'm sorry to see it end in such a less than magnanimous fashion <eos> YOU: you need water and i need food so unless we do 1 food to 1water is tht okay <eos> THEM: i'll tell you what i'm willing to do . . i can't really budge on the water . . but . . i could do something where i take 2 water , and only one firewood , but two food . . does that work for you ? <eos> YOU: so if i were to give you water what would i get ? <eos> THEM: you'd be getting 1 water , 2 firewood , and 1 food <eos> YOU: how much food are you willing to offer for water <eos> THEM: we can go back to my original offer which was honestly more generous . . i get 2 water , 1 firewood , 1 food . . you get 1 water , 2 firewood , 2 food . . its honestly a better deal for you <eos> YOU: no its not i give you i water i get 1 food and 1 firewood <eos> THEM: we only have 3 of each to divide up . . so yes , you're going to have to give me one more on an item . . but in exchange i'm giving you 1 more on two different items . i'm getting 4 items in total , you're getting 5 . . - you're essentially netting 11 % more 'items' than i am in this deal . <eos> YOU: thats the point as you need water so badly <eos> THEM: correct . . i do . . but if you're not willing to budge on this where you're still netting more overall value i understand - i'm bummed but i understand . <eos> YOU: im contented with what i have but im willing to trade as yu need more water so i need t make a profit <eos> THEM: that's unfortunate then as instead of making a tiny bit less of a profit now you're not going to make any because you would rather give up the deal . also , if you do the math , you'll see that i'm actually benefiting you here - i understand , though . i can put through the offer and hope you change your mind so we both benefit . <eos> YOU: im fine with that <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello there ! i think we both are going after the extra stuff . i was wondering if i could get most / all of the firewood and maybe some of the water because i forgot to buy them . <eos> THEM: well i really need the water because i've been sick ( i won't go into details ) , but i'm a bit dehydrated . <eos> YOU: im sorry to hear that . that fine you can get the water if you need it . but is it fine that i get 3 firewood then ? i really dont have any <eos> THEM: i need at least 1 firewood . i forgot to bring warm clothes unfortunately . how about i take 3 water 1 wood and all the food ? <eos> YOU: that is a little problematic for me because i did not bring enough also . maybe we can split this up a little more evenly ? <eos> THEM: okay . i have a few hotdogs but i definitely need some chips or something to go with them . maybe we can split the food up . but as for water i would like 2 at least . i don't think i can survive without it . <eos> YOU: that sounds good . how about i get 2 firewood and you get 2 waters so we have some for both of us and maybe be let me have 2 foods cause i did not bring any and you already have some ? <eos> THEM: sounds good except i could really use a bit more food . i'm trying to bulk you know ? i would hate to waste my hard earned gains . <eos> YOU: if thats the case i am willing to trade the leftover firewood you have for the one extra food . i mean the weather isn't suppose to be " that " cold any ways . <eos> THEM: okay you can have 1 water 2 wood and 2 food . i'll just lose my gains i suppose . sound good ? <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>
<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: im ready <eos> YOU: my offer would be that i get 3 packages of water , 2 of firewood , and 1 of food . i get dehydrated easily so i am constantly drinking water . <eos> THEM: i counter with i get 2 of each item and you get 1 of each item since i will be camping with my kids i will need more supplies <eos> YOU: i am camping with my boyfriend so 1 of each wouldn't be enough for us . i think food could be a problem for you guys so i think having all the packages of food would be fair . <eos> THEM: so how about we get 3 food , 1 water and 1 firewood and you guys 2 water and 2 firewood <eos> YOU: i would be fine with us getting 2 water and 3 firewood . your kids could help gather firewood quickly around the campsite . <eos> THEM: lol , true i think we can settle on that <eos> YOU: i think it is fair to both of us . <eos> THEM: so we get 3 food 1 water and you guys get 3 firewood and 2 water right <eos> YOU: correct . have fun on your trip ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=0 item2=2 item0=0 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>
<input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi there ! i was looking for 3 extra packages of food and 3 packages of firewood . <eos> THEM: we can work a deal out . how's your day ? <eos> YOU: it's good , thank you which package is the most important for you to have on your trip do you think ? <eos> THEM: that would be firewood . even though is really hot there , it gets cold at night . how's the weather for you ? <eos> YOU: ah yes , you'll definitely need some extra wood then ! it's also pretty cold here , especially during the night . but i would definitely be willing to let you take 2 firewood in exchange for 3 food . we have a lot of people going and will be out in the middle of nowhere . <eos> THEM: we can definitely work something out . i'll be sure it'll benefit you more than me . <eos> YOU: oh , well that's really nice of you . what do you propose ? <eos> THEM: you'll get 3 food and 2 water , and i'll take 3 firewood and 1 water . <eos> YOU: hmm , i think that could definitely work ! appreciate it <eos> THEM: sound great <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=3 item2=2 item0=3 item1=0 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>
<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi , how are you ? <eos> THEM: i am good , and you ? we are heading out to camp at joshua tree np . it is hot in the day , and we will be doing some rockclimbing and hiking . there is no firewood out there to collect or buy , so i'm hoping to take the firewood and water . <eos> YOU: that is a bummer since i was hoping for more firewood as well , i am really afraid of wild animals so i will need a big fire <eos> THEM: yes , wild animals can be a problem in some locales . i suggest an effective spray and carrying a knife at all times . i am willing to part with one firewood if i can secure the three waters . does this work for you ? <eos> YOU: i was really hoping for more firewood and water than that , how about you get two firewoods and two waters and i get the rest of the items ? or the other way around would work as well for me ? <eos> THEM: sorry , that won't work for me . are you able to collect wood where you are camping ? i am afraid that i don't want to budge on the firewood , with one exception . without the extra firewood , we would probably need more food that doesn't need to be cooked . i could give up the two firewood and take three waters and two food . <eos> YOU: if you will take three waters and two foods that would work for me , that way you get five items to my four . <eos> THEM: no , firewood is my highest priority . if i give up the firewood , i would like all the food and water . <eos> YOU: that would make it 6 to 3 as far as the items go , how about i get 1 firewood and 3 foods , i am taking a loss but that really is as low as i can go <eos> THEM: i can accept that . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: it's so good to be talking to you before this historic camping trip we're all going to be going on . you're gonna love it . but before we go , we need to figure out the best deal for everybody , and that's what i want . i want all of us to win . tell me , what do you need most in the world ? i'm gonna get that for you . <eos> THEM: that would be awesome ! i really need some more water . i need it so that i can take my medications with it . it's very important to me . to get this , i'm willing to give you as much firewood as you need . how does that sound to you ? <eos> YOU: that's tough , real tough . everybody wants you to be able to take your medicine , and it wold be terrific if you could , but everyone has to make sacrifices for the greater good . i need all of the water . non negotiable . that sounds tough , i know , but i'm ready to give you the deal of a life time for it . a deal you've never seen before and won't see again . i'll take all the water , it's true , but in return i'm offering you two wood and all the food . a dynamite deal . <eos> THEM: oh wow . that is tough . that is a good deal . may i ask - why do you need the water ? <eos> YOU: the world is a scary place out there , it's getting tougher for us regular people to get by , especially with companies dumping chemicals in our water supplies , poisoning us . i'm pledging to my camping group , we're gonna have the cleanest water around . so clean they won't believe it . frankly even i don't believe it and i'm seeing it with my own eyes . they're gonna love it . <eos> THEM: i think that's a very noble cause . maybe other people in our camping group can supply some water ? i'd be more than happy to give you two waters , and i will take just 1 water for myself , even though i need it very badly for my health . <eos> YOU: you're making this tough for me . real tough . i'm not a bad guy though . i'm willing to help the people even if i don't agree wit them . it's going to cost you though . if you get one water , i'm going to need two wood . you scratch my back , i scratch yours . everybody gets the best deal . you're making out like a bandit with all the food . that'll be terrific for you . <eos> THEM: how important is the wood to you ? ideally , how many would you need ? <eos> YOU: if you're getting one water , i have to have two wood . i'm already breaking my pledge not to negotiate on the water . that's huge . i have to come out of this looking strong for my people . they're not going to like seeing me break on such a big pledge i made . you get one water , one wood and three food . that'll be big for you , getting the entire stack like that . huge ! <eos> THEM: i think this is a fair proposal . . . i'll be willing to give up two of my wood ( even though it is very high priority ) since you are generous enough to give me a water . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello ! i am going camping at joshua tree np in very warm and dry conditions . we have a pretty large group . i am looking to take the extra water and firewood . the evenings will be cool and there is not much wood there . <eos> THEM: hi . . i can understand your concern . i'll be okay to share with you water packs . my area is covered by full winter . i need at least 2 pack of firewood . <eos> YOU: thanks for considering my water needs . . . i can see that the firewood would be important for you . i could give up two of the firewood to you , but that would be a problem . we were planning to do some hunting and cook some of our food . without the firewood , i would need to bring more food . i am willing to give you two of the firewood packages if you could leave the 3 food packages for me . we have a large group and about one / third of them are college - age - - they like and need to eat . <eos> THEM: i'm happy to hear that you are considering my need . i have 2 children in my house . i need at least ! pack of food to feed them . kindly consider it . <eos> YOU: i am willing to do that . you can take two of the firewood and one food , and i will take the water , other firewood and 2 food packages . do you agree ? <eos> THEM: i need 1 pack of water , 1 pack of food , 2 pack of fire wood . totally i will take 4 packs . you are going to take 5 packs . <eos> YOU: i think it is important to consider that it is about need , not just about evenness of distribution . you are going to be camping in wintry , snowy conditions where a lot of water is not needed . i urge you to reconsider my offer . if you are just going with your immediate family , you should be fine . i have over 20 in my group . <eos> THEM: if in this case , you take 3 pack of water and provide me 3 pack of firewood . will this okay for u ? <eos> YOU: what about the food ? <eos> THEM: 1 pack of food is enough for me . you take 2 pack . i think this will work for you . <eos> YOU: sorry , that won't work for me . without enough extra food , i will need more firewood . my counter offer is to take the three waters and three food . i am running out of time , and if we don't work out a deal , then we'll both suffer . please reconsider . <eos> THEM: please consider . i'm ready to share you 2 pack of food . 3 pack of water . i just need only one food . without food , my children will suffer . that is the main reason . kindly consider it . <eos> YOU: no , that won't work for me . i will make a final offer or i walk away . i will take the water , and two firewood , and you can take the food which you and one firewood . that is my final offer or i will have to walk away . <eos> THEM: why suddenly changed your decision ? as you already mentioned , i'll take 3 firewood . 1 pack water . you take other things . if this is not fine , let me know we'll come for an conclusion . <eos>  </dialogue> <output> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hy thats my offer <eos> THEM: hi there . . i'm sorry , i didn't see your offer as it doesn't show it for 10 messages , i believe . so , here's the situation . . i think i can get by with less firewood as i'm a floridian and prefer it cooler anyway . . also the food is not a huge thing for me as we can catch / improvise around the campsite - but i'm definitely interested in as much water as possible . . both for cooking and cleaning purposes , as well as drinking , of course . <eos> YOU: okay so what do you suggest <eos> THEM: well , i recognize you're gonna need water too . . so i'd love to take 2 of them , giving you one and i'm totally ok with going 1 on the firewood and one on the food . . that way we all ensure we have enough . . you're making out a bit better in quantity that way but i think its best for both of us <eos> YOU: i botttle of water for a can of food and 2 firewoods <eos> THEM: yeah , sorry , that's not going to work out for me . i'm going to need at least 2 bottles of water , 1 food packet , and one firewood . . again , this does leave you with two each on the food and the firewood , which are both very important things for this camping trip ! <eos> YOU: but thats the only offer im willing to give <eos> THEM: well then unfortunately i think we're gonna have to walk away from this and neither of us gets anything we could both use . . that's unfortunate and i'm sorry to see it end in such a less than magnanimous fashion <eos> YOU: you need water and i need food so unless we do 1 food to 1water is tht okay <eos> THEM: i'll tell you what i'm willing to do . . i can't really budge on the water . . but . . i could do something where i take 2 water , and only one firewood , but two food . . does that work for you ? <eos> YOU: so if i were to give you water what would i get ? <eos> THEM: you'd be getting 1 water , 2 firewood , and 1 food <eos> YOU: how much food are you willing to offer for water <eos> THEM: we can go back to my original offer which was honestly more generous . . i get 2 water , 1 firewood , 1 food . . you get 1 water , 2 firewood , 2 food . . its honestly a better deal for you <eos> YOU: no its not i give you i water i get 1 food and 1 firewood <eos> THEM: we only have 3 of each to divide up . . so yes , you're going to have to give me one more on an item . . but in exchange i'm giving you 1 more on two different items . i'm getting 4 items in total , you're getting 5 . . - you're essentially netting 11 % more 'items' than i am in this deal . <eos> YOU: thats the point as you need water so badly <eos> THEM: correct . . i do . . but if you're not willing to budge on this where you're still netting more overall value i understand - i'm bummed but i understand . <eos> YOU: im contented with what i have but im willing to trade as yu need more water so i need t make a profit <eos> THEM: that's unfortunate then as instead of making a tiny bit less of a profit now you're not going to make any because you would rather give up the deal . also , if you do the math , you'll see that i'm actually benefiting you here - i understand , though . i can put through the offer and hope you change your mind so we both benefit . <eos> YOU: im fine with that <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi there ! i was looking for 3 extra packages of food and 3 packages of firewood . <eos> THEM: we can work a deal out . how's your day ? <eos> YOU: it's good , thank you which package is the most important for you to have on your trip do you think ? <eos> THEM: that would be firewood . even though is really hot there , it gets cold at night . how's the weather for you ? <eos> YOU: ah yes , you'll definitely need some extra wood then ! it's also pretty cold here , especially during the night . but i would definitely be willing to let you take 2 firewood in exchange for 3 food . we have a lot of people going and will be out in the middle of nowhere . <eos> THEM: we can definitely work something out . i'll be sure it'll benefit you more than me . <eos> YOU: oh , well that's really nice of you . what do you propose ? <eos> THEM: you'll get 3 food and 2 water , and i'll take 3 firewood and 1 water . <eos> YOU: hmm , i think that could definitely work ! appreciate it <eos> THEM: sound great <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=3 item2=2 item0=3 item1=0 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>
<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi , how are you ? <eos> THEM: i am good , and you ? we are heading out to camp at joshua tree np . it is hot in the day , and we will be doing some rockclimbing and hiking . there is no firewood out there to collect or buy , so i'm hoping to take the firewood and water . <eos> YOU: that is a bummer since i was hoping for more firewood as well , i am really afraid of wild animals so i will need a big fire <eos> THEM: yes , wild animals can be a problem in some locales . i suggest an effective spray and carrying a knife at all times . i am willing to part with one firewood if i can secure the three waters . does this work for you ? <eos> YOU: i was really hoping for more firewood and water than that , how about you get two firewoods and two waters and i get the rest of the items ? or the other way around would work as well for me ? <eos> THEM: sorry , that won't work for me . are you able to collect wood where you are camping ? i am afraid that i don't want to budge on the firewood , with one exception . without the extra firewood , we would probably need more food that doesn't need to be cooked . i could give up the two firewood and take three waters and two food . <eos> YOU: if you will take three waters and two foods that would work for me , that way you get five items to my four . <eos> THEM: no , firewood is my highest priority . if i give up the firewood , i would like all the food and water . <eos> YOU: that would make it 6 to 3 as far as the items go , how about i get 1 firewood and 3 foods , i am taking a loss but that really is as low as i can go <eos> THEM: i can accept that . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: it's so good to be talking to you before this historic camping trip we're all going to be going on . you're gonna love it . but before we go , we need to figure out the best deal for everybody , and that's what i want . i want all of us to win . tell me , what do you need most in the world ? i'm gonna get that for you . <eos> THEM: that would be awesome ! i really need some more water . i need it so that i can take my medications with it . it's very important to me . to get this , i'm willing to give you as much firewood as you need . how does that sound to you ? <eos> YOU: that's tough , real tough . everybody wants you to be able to take your medicine , and it wold be terrific if you could , but everyone has to make sacrifices for the greater good . i need all of the water . non negotiable . that sounds tough , i know , but i'm ready to give you the deal of a life time for it . a deal you've never seen before and won't see again . i'll take all the water , it's true , but in return i'm offering you two wood and all the food . a dynamite deal . <eos> THEM: oh wow . that is tough . that is a good deal . may i ask - why do you need the water ? <eos> YOU: the world is a scary place out there , it's getting tougher for us regular people to get by , especially with companies dumping chemicals in our water supplies , poisoning us . i'm pledging to my camping group , we're gonna have the cleanest water around . so clean they won't believe it . frankly even i don't believe it and i'm seeing it with my own eyes . they're gonna love it . <eos> THEM: i think that's a very noble cause . maybe other people in our camping group can supply some water ? i'd be more than happy to give you two waters , and i will take just 1 water for myself , even though i need it very badly for my health . <eos> YOU: you're making this tough for me . real tough . i'm not a bad guy though . i'm willing to help the people even if i don't agree wit them . it's going to cost you though . if you get one water , i'm going to need two wood . you scratch my back , i scratch yours . everybody gets the best deal . you're making out like a bandit with all the food . that'll be terrific for you . <eos> THEM: how important is the wood to you ? ideally , how many would you need ? <eos> YOU: if you're getting one water , i have to have two wood . i'm already breaking my pledge not to negotiate on the water . that's huge . i have to come out of this looking strong for my people . they're not going to like seeing me break on such a big pledge i made . you get one water , one wood and three food . that'll be big for you , getting the entire stack like that . huge ! <eos> THEM: i think this is a fair proposal . . . i'll be willing to give up two of my wood ( even though it is very high priority ) since you are generous enough to give me a water . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi i was wondering if i could get 3 packages of firewood ? <eos> THEM: hey there , unfortunately , i'm in a bit of a quandary with firewood too , as i am going to a place where it's fairly cold and will need more for heat . <eos> YOU: thats terrible ! i broke my leg and wont be able to collect my own firewood , could i maybe get 2 packages ? <eos> THEM: terribly sorry to hear that ; it sounds like you won't be able to camp much in that condition . i assume you have someone coming along to help you because of your leg ? <eos> YOU: just a bunch of children under 5 who wont be able to gather firewood . so i desperately need at least 2 <eos> THEM: i see , well it sounds like you're going to need some additional food with those children . how about i provide you with some additional food and you can help me with my need for heat with firewood ? <eos> YOU: okay how i take all 3 food and 1 firewood ? <eos> THEM: the firewood sounds like a solid deal ; i would need a little food though to assist me . the good news is since there's a stream near me , i won't need any additional water , so i am happy to provide you with all of the additional water . <eos> YOU: i am not able to do that unfortunately i desperately need firewood . <eos> THEM: perhaps i wasn't clear , so if i take 2 firewood , you take 1 ; i would just need some help with some of the food . is that reasonable ? <eos> YOU: i guues <eos> THEM: so let's make sure this is reasonable ; firewood - 2 for me , 1 for you ; water 2 for you , 1 for me , and you can have all of the water ? <eos> YOU: sounds good . 1 firewood for me 2 food for me and i can have all water . to clarify . sorry about typos <eos> THEM: no worries , ok that sounds good ; i'm going to submit the deal . <eos> YOU: nice <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=3 item0=2 item1=1 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi ! i'm super excited to camping with my family ! we have had to cancel all our original travel plans due to covid and we're really looking forward to this trip . especially my son ! he's been so restless at home . are you going camping too ? <eos> THEM: yes , i am ! i can't wait . i'm going on a 3 week trip to this gorgeous lake . <eos> YOU: wow , 3 weeks is a long camping trip ! i don't know if i have enough supplies to go for a trip that long . are you doing a cabin - style or really roughing it ? my husband and son want to do a lot of hiking so we're thinking of moving camp daily . <eos> THEM: that's awesome ! i know , i'm a little worried about my food supplies but i think i can figure everything else out . no , we're roughing it , my boyfriend's huge on camping . <eos> YOU: lol , at least it sounds like you've got an expert with you . my husband is really gung - ho but he tends to fly by the edge of his seat when it comes to stuff like planning . he's says he wants to travel light and that he got these water filter straws so that we could drink lake water but i'm super sketched out . . . i don't want us getting something like schistosomiasis . and i want to make sure everyone stays hydrated with all of the hiking they want to do <eos> THEM: i get that . i'm going to risk it with the lake water because i'd personally love to have enough food to last 3 weeks ( which i'm a little worried about as it is ) , so i can definitely help you out with the water . <eos> YOU: thanks ! where do you plan on camping ? i know popular places are worried about spreading covid and a lot of offices that give out camping permits are closed . <eos> THEM: we're going to check out acadia national park . i'm not totally sure on the details , i'm letting my boyfriend plan and i'm just handling the packing haha <eos> YOU: lol , that's totally understandable . are you planning to make any campfires ? <eos> THEM: some , but i'm not too worried about my firewood stock . i'm pretty sure there's a decent amount of wood out there in the park . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>
