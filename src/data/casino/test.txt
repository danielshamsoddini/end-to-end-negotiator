<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , i am a lifelong camper . my favorite part of camping is sitting by the fire at night . i propose 3 packages of firewood for me , 1 water and 1 food . <eos> THEM: camping's definitely something i enjoy a lot too , but i also love to cook and would want at least a little wood to make a nice meal . i'd also like to go hiking at least once while i'm out . what about 3 food , one wood , and one water for myself ? <eos> YOU: well i need at least 1 food for myself . i'm very active , too . i love to hike and i imagine i would be very hungry . i need to replenish those calories . <eos> THEM: well remember that we both have enough food already for our trip , so this would just be some extra . would it make you feel any better if i brought you some of the food i made ? <eos> YOU: in the era of social distancing , i would rather cook my own food , but that was very nice of you to offer . <eos> THEM: yeah , i definitely know what you mean there . it sounds like you're more active than me so i think we can definitely agree on you getting two of the water and me just getting one for now <eos> YOU: okay let's agree to me getting 2 water and you getting 1 water . as for the firewood , it is really important to me to get 3 . camping is my life . my parents took us camping all throughout my childhood . we loved sitting around the fire together at night and having a good time . my parents have since passed on and i really need the extra firewood to keep this tradition and memories alive . <eos> THEM: sorry for your loss . i can respect wanting to keep them in your thoughts with a roaring bonfire or three while you're out , but are you going alone ? i'm going with a group of four so there's going to be at least someone there that will also want a bigger fire one night even if i don't . <eos> YOU: i will have 3 people with me . my son , my sister and her daughter . so okay , how about i take 2 firewood , 2 water and 1 food ? <eos> THEM: i think that's pretty agreeable for covering our bases ; though if your kids are young i could see you not needing two extra containers of water since you're probably not going on any short hikes . the food and fire seems respectful to both of our needs <eos> YOU: my son is 15 and my niece is 13 . they are athletes . we will be doing hiking and biking . we will be needing the extra water . <eos> THEM: alright then ; we were focusing more on canoeing with a bit of hiking on the side so i suppose i'll cede you the extra water . if it sounds good to you i'll submit my deal of 2 food , 1 water , 1 firewood now . <eos> YOU: ok i think that is fair <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 9 3 6 </partner_input>
