<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi as a starting point i just put in an initial proposal <eos> YOU: i'm unable to see your proposal . i'm hoping to get at least 2 additional packages of firewood . i forgot my sleeping bag and blankets , so extra firewood would help me stay warm at night . <eos> THEM: i was hoping for two packages of firewood as well . . . i would need it to heat the food and water <eos> YOU: i would be willing to give you the 2 packages of firewood if i'm able to take all of the food and one water . my dog is coming on the camping trip and i'm worried with all the extra activity he won't have enough food and water packed for the weekend . <eos> THEM: i would need one food and one water in addition to the firewood . alternatively , you can have 2 firewoods if i could have 2 foods and 2 waters <eos> YOU: i would feel better about our trip if i was able to have 2 firewood 1 food and 2 waters . is that something you would be interested in doing ? i think i can make do on the food , but extra water for my pup would be ideal . <eos> THEM: so if you have the extra firewood you can boil water at the campsite for your dog . i am a dog lover as well and want to be sure they are taken care of . i propose we set up a ratio of 2to 1 for firewood and water ( if you get two firewood you get one water and vice versa ) that seems they only way for us both to have something that we can work with <eos> YOU: i appreciate that you're a fellow dog lover . i hadn't thought about boiling water . a 2:1 ratio seems fair to me . <eos> THEM: how about if the person who get the two firewood ( which seems to be the most desirable entity ) only gets 1 food and the person who gets the lesser valued water gets the extra food . that seems fair to me <eos> YOU: i can agree with that . the firewood is my biggest concern because i forgot the blankets ! as long as i'm warm , i should be able to make do on 1 food and 1 water . <eos> THEM: okay so i propose you get two firewood , one water and one food . i get one firewood , two food and two water . do you agree ? <eos> YOU: yes , i agree . i'll submit the deal now . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi , we are going to be camping neighbors it seems like . <eos> YOU: hi ! it does seem that way . do you have any kids ? <eos> THEM: yes actually , 2 of them . a boy and girl . <eos> YOU: nice , maybe ours can play together some . i know mine seem to fight less when they have other people to play with <eos> THEM: i think having extra kids around always helps keep them out of trouble . <eos> YOU: it looks like we have some extra packages that need to be divvied up . is there anything you prefer ? <eos> THEM: i was just going to ask you the same question . i would prefer more firewood considering there isn't much to source at the camp site and all our sleeping bags are for lighter weather . i'd like to keep the kids warm . other than that water would be nice too . they always dump it out thinking they are watering plants . . : ( <eos> YOU: we brought plenty of water and a filtration system because i am anal about hydration . <eos> THEM: that's always a good thing . i had one but the kids left it in the sand . . . what packages do you feel you need most ? <eos> YOU: my kids eat all the time so i can take the food and you can take the water and that will leave the firewood . i wish they had 4 packages so we could divide it evenly . we cook mostly on the fire and always sit around the fire at night . <eos> THEM: that would be nice , it would make things abit more fair . i really need a little fire wood for keeping the kids more warm though . i can bring a propane stove so i think 1 extra bundle would work for us . i wouldn't mind giving up 2 food for you and the kids , i can manage with what i have on hand and i can take 2 waters . does that seem fair ? <eos> YOU: sounds good . i will take 2 food , 2 firewood and 1 water leaving you with the rest . <eos> THEM: i think that's fair and works for me . i don't mind a little challenge stretching things with the kids . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi there , good to connect with you . how are you today ? <eos> THEM: i am good , thank you . what are your preferences ? i really need the extra food packages . we are doing a lot of hiking and mountain biking and there are no grocery stores for at least 50 miles . <eos> YOU: oh wow that is quite a lot of hiking ! i think we will be hanging out a lot overnight and so i am looking for more firewood if possible . my kids can't hike very far and want to do more with smores and marshmellows . <eos> THEM: i can work with that . i am willing to give you all of the firewood . we are in a hot climate and won't need too much . being in a hot climate and with a lot of exercise , i am hoping to take the three water packages . <eos> YOU: thank you for that . i'm happy to give you the food packages as well as we shouldn't need extras . being around the fire , we are going to be hot as well and dehydrated . i say let's try and split the waters . <eos> THEM: we are going to be in an area where there is little potable water . i don't have a water filter either . the extra water will be very important for our group . <eos> YOU: i understand . we will have a big group ( about 10 people ) so we are trying to have as much water as possible as well . if anyone gets dehydrated it'd be the end of the trip and hard to get everyone back to base . what's the fewest amount of bottles you're willing to accept ? <eos> THEM: two packages is the lowest i would accept . there is one exception to that . if you were willing to give up 2 firewood , then i would be willing to take 1 water . i think i could trade some extra firewood for water at the campsite . <eos> YOU: i understand . i am not willing to give up any firewood , but i'd be willing to do a trade of 1 food for 1 water . so 3 firewood for us , 1 water for us , and 1 food for us . <eos> THEM: sorry , that won't work for me . my counteroffer is i will take three waters and two food packages and give you all of the firewood and 1 food . i am running out of time , and if we don't agree , we will both lose out , so please consider this last offer . <eos> YOU: okay i can live with that . <eos> THEM: great ! let's finalize then . . . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 9 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi , i'm excited about the camping trip and i hope to make it better with this deal . i'd like to get 2 firewood packages , 1 water package and 2 food packages . <eos> YOU: hi ! lol nice to meet you too . . . i'm going camping too , but i'm taking the whole family , and teenage kids mean we need a lot of food <eos> THEM: ok , i'm willing to give up one of my food packages because you are taking a large family . i'd like to have an extra water package to stay hydrated since i'm an active person who likes to run . <eos> YOU: i would prefer to have all of the extra food packages . you can have 2 of the water , and i'll throw in all three of the firewood if you're down for that <eos> THEM: i think that is a fair deal but i'm not ready to give up one of the food packages just yet . i will need the extra food because of a high metabolism . would you be willing to trade a firewood package for it ? you might need it to cook some of your extra food . : ) do you camp often ? would you be able to enjoy camping in extreme climates ? <eos> YOU: i have , as a matter of fact , enough times to know that there's not a lot firewood can do that a portable generator and a space heater can't . i've got those , and i'm fine eating cold food , because i'm camping out in the desert . how about you ? are you sure you don't want that extra wood ? <eos> THEM: i think you make a good argument and i am reluctantly willing to give away the 3 food packages . the rest of the deal seems fair as well . i've always had good experiences camping and i could use the extra firewood for heat since i enjoy camping in cold weather climates . <eos> YOU: so aside from me getting the 3 food ? how would you like to split up the rest ? i'd like to get at least 1 water if i could . <eos> THEM: ok , i'd like to get the other 2 packages of water in the deal we made earlier . i don't know what the weather will be like and could use all the water i can get since i will perspire most of it . <eos> YOU: ok . then let me propose that i get 3 food and 1 water , and you get 2 water and 3 firewood . <eos> THEM: that sounds great ! i will submit the deal . hope you have a nice day and best of luck on your camping trip ! <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=3 item2=1 item0=1 item1=0 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi i was wondering if i could maybe get 2 of the water since i left half of mine at home and you could take 1 water if you need ? does this sound ok ? <eos> THEM: i'm sorry . i brought my dogs so i would need 2 bottles for me . you could have 1 . i would give you all my firewood since i would not use it . <eos> YOU: okay that sounds wonderful i broke my leg and am only camping with kids so they cant help me gather firewood so it is ok if i take all three firewood ? so kind of you ! <eos> THEM: yes of course , you can have all of it . <eos> YOU: ok , so what do we think about the food ? do you need any food at all ? what are your thoughts ? lets come to a good compromise ! <eos> THEM: sounds great , i would want all the food . would hope that you can manage with some food of your own , i guess this would not be a difficult task . i cannot cook so any pre - packaged food would be good for me and my dogs . <eos> YOU: what kind of dogs do you have ? do they eat a lot ? i know small dogs tend to eat less so maybe all the packages could be too much for u guys <eos> THEM: i do have a poodle and a yorkie and maltese mix . the poodle is standard size , that baby eats a bit ! i guess i would also need extra food since i would be cutting my own firewood and that would mean i would need to hike a bit . <eos> YOU: the dog i grew up with was a toy poodle ! ! they are such cute and smart pups ! ! ! ! i wish i had a standard poodle now . i have a boxer and hes a silly nut ! i understand why you need extra . i was just trying to at least get two for my trip for the kiddos . we had some kids join last minute and i definitely dont have enough to feed them all . <eos> THEM: sorry to hear , however too many can jeopardize the trip . it can also be dangerous to bring so many kids since any of them could get sick or worst scenario that would get into some kind of trouble . if i were you i would not bring such large group . i definitely need all the food given since it has been a while that i do not camp or have a vacation so that is why i would love to bring my dogs along . <eos> YOU: well i didnt have a choice to bring them but here we are lol . but could you at least give me one package of food ? <eos> THEM: i am sorry , i could give you an extra water and i keep 1 . i do need the food and you do have a choice , you can just be honest to them and let them know you don't have enough food . i believe that too many people can definitely jeopardize . <eos> YOU: okay that sounds like a deal . ill take all the fire ill take 2 water and you have all the food sound good ? <eos> THEM: sounds great , good deal ! i'm sure we will have a lot of adventure in this trip . <eos> YOU: thanks hun hope those little dogs dont dehydrate and overheat . it would be a shame . have fun ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=0 item2=2 item0=0 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi i was wondering if i could get 3 packages of firewood ? <eos> THEM: hey there , unfortunately , i'm in a bit of a quandary with firewood too , as i am going to a place where it's fairly cold and will need more for heat . <eos> YOU: thats terrible ! i broke my leg and wont be able to collect my own firewood , could i maybe get 2 packages ? <eos> THEM: terribly sorry to hear that ; it sounds like you won't be able to camp much in that condition . i assume you have someone coming along to help you because of your leg ? <eos> YOU: just a bunch of children under 5 who wont be able to gather firewood . so i desperately need at least 2 <eos> THEM: i see , well it sounds like you're going to need some additional food with those children . how about i provide you with some additional food and you can help me with my need for heat with firewood ? <eos> YOU: okay how i take all 3 food and 1 firewood ? <eos> THEM: the firewood sounds like a solid deal ; i would need a little food though to assist me . the good news is since there's a stream near me , i won't need any additional water , so i am happy to provide you with all of the additional water . <eos> YOU: i am not able to do that unfortunately i desperately need firewood . <eos> THEM: perhaps i wasn't clear , so if i take 2 firewood , you take 1 ; i would just need some help with some of the food . is that reasonable ? <eos> YOU: i guues <eos> THEM: so let's make sure this is reasonable ; firewood - 2 for me , 1 for you ; water 2 for you , 1 for me , and you can have all of the water ? <eos> YOU: sounds good . 1 firewood for me 2 food for me and i can have all water . to clarify . sorry about typos <eos> THEM: no worries , ok that sounds good ; i'm going to submit the deal . <eos> YOU: nice <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=3 item0=2 item1=1 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: what are your priorities with the packages ? because i would be camping with my family i would really need the extra water , and probably also some firewood . <eos> YOU: well that is the same as me as i have small children and need extra of all three items <eos> THEM: is there an item you would like over the others ? <eos> YOU: well maybe the water as we will need to cook with it as well <eos> THEM: i also would need water , but i also really enjoy campfires too , which i would want extra wood for . <eos> YOU: not willing to give up much wood ! how are you feeling about the food ? <eos> THEM: i don't think i would need too much extra food . more concerned about running out of water , or having extra wood . do you have a suggested split for the packages ? <eos> YOU: how about i get 4 firewoods and 4 waters and you get 4 food items ? <eos> THEM: no i am not okay with that deal . we will need to split it up more evenly <eos> YOU: what is your best offer for me to think about ? <eos> THEM: so we only get 3 items of each not 4 . so my offer would be that you get 2 waters , i get 1 . i'll take 3 firewood , and you can have 2 food , and i have 1 <eos> YOU: that sounds fair so lets enter it to submit ! thanks for working with me ! <eos> THEM: your welcome <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>
