However, I am also in need of extra firewood and would need it for cooking purposes. How about I take 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water?  <eos> THEM: thats a bit rough i offer 1 firewood 1 food and 2 water for you then we both have something. <eos> YOU: I think we're getting closer to an agreement How about 1 firewood, 2 food, and one water? <eos> THEM: ok i got one more offer 1 firewood 1 food and 3 waters for you you got to be thirsty on your trip <eos> YOU: I'll accept that <eos> THEM: great good deal <eos> YOU: Thank you! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=3 item0=2 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>
<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hello I would like to take 2 firewood packages 2 food packages and 2 water packages. I am camping in the desert with 30 + kids on a school trip and we had a few more children come on the trip last min and need to make sure they are warm fed and hydrated. <eos> YOU: I'm sorry, I couldn't possibly give you the majority of everything. I have a large group myself, including a baby that I need to keep warm. I need to have 2 of the firewood, and I can give you two of either the food or the water, but not two of both. <eos> THEM: how old is your baby ? <eos> YOU: she's 6 months old. so i really need to keep her warm. <eos> THEM: ok well given that the 6 month old babies main nutrients comes from breastmilk or formula and you have to hold the baby to feed them plus you should have blanket for the baby which will keep the baby warm. I will consider taking 1 firewood and 2 foods and 1 water.  <eos> YOU: I think that should be OK. So I get 2 firewood, one food, and 2 water. <eos> THEM: Yes i can agree to that!  I sure do miss having a 6 month old baby to snuggle lol. mine is 2 and is not interested in snuggling anymore. <eos> YOU: it is definitely a wonderful time!! Thank you for the firewood, so that I can keep her warm. <eos> THEM: Yes and thank you for the food to keep these children feed and happy they will definitely appreciate it and i will definitely appreciate not having hungry irritable children for the week..  <eos> YOU: you're welcome. i'm glad we were able to make a deal. <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>

So that is the next most important thing for me.  <eos> THEM: OK, how about you take 2 water and 1 food and I firewood? <eos> YOU: Could I have 2 water and 2 food instead? There are 9 items. Obviously, one person will get 4 and the other 5. If I am getting 4, I would prefer 2 food items.  <eos> THEM: I really will need 2 of either the water or the food, you can decide if you would like. <eos> YOU: Then can I get 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood? <eos> THEM: Sure, that sounds good! <eos> YOU: Okay, then we have a deal.  <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

You can have the rest :-) <eos> THEM: Well hello there, fellow camper.  I'm not sure I'd like to go without firewood.  Would you accept two firewood and two food? <eos> YOU: Let me think about that, fellow traveller. What's your highest priority to make this a great trip for you? :-) <eos> THEM: Honestly, with as warm as it is I'm a big fan of extra water.   <eos> YOU: Ha! You got that right!How about taking two waters for me having the two firewoo and two food? <eos> THEM: What's your medium preference look like, assuming firewood is most important to you.  Would you take two firewood and all three food? <eos> YOU: That sounds good. I'll give you all 3 waters for two firewood and sll three foods <eos> THEM: I can definitely live with that.  I think it balances out our wants pretty nicely. <eos> YOU: I think so, too. So I give you all 3 water and  one firewood, you give me all 3 food and 2 firewood. Correct? <eos> THEM: Absolutely, and I hope you have a warm sleeping bag as well.

<input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: I feel like I can make due without a lot of extra water, but I'm a little concerned about my ability to get food in an emergency. <eos> THEM: I brought a pretty good amount of food due to my diabetes so I'm good in that area. I only need a little extra. <eos> YOU: What are you most desirous of?  <eos> THEM: I have enough food to make sure I counteract low blood sugar but water is essential to me because I get dehydrated a lot, and I didn't bring enough water. <eos> YOU: I feel like firewood is helpful with everything.  Keeps you warm, can cook food, and can be used to sterilize water as well. <eos> THEM: True I feel the same. The thing is I'm anemic and get cold easily so I'd prefer 2 of the firewoods. <eos> YOU: I think if I were going to give up 2 of the firewoods I'd want to get all three of the food. <eos> THEM: I don't know if I can give you all the extra food. I can negotiate and let you have two of the firewoods. because I did bring an extra blanket. <eos> YOU: Well, food is definitely my biggest concern.  How much of the water did you want?  That's the least of my concerns because I feel like water can be found most readily. <eos> THEM: I would like two of the waters because I can only drink purified water. So firewood is your next biggest concern? <eos> YOU: No, food is my bigger concern.  If your biggest concern is water, what about me getting all the food and you getting all the water? <eos> THEM: Food isn't my biggest concern but it is still a concern. I suffer from low blood sugar so it's essential for me to eat a certain amount of healthy foods. i can give you 2 of the food packages but I'd like to keep one for myself. I'd like two of the waters and only one of the firewoods. :-) <eos> YOU: That sounds reasonable.  That gives each of us some of everything, which I think makes sense.   Why don't you propose that and I'll agree to it. <eos> THEM: Great you have a deal. I'm happy we were able to come to a compromise. :-D <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

What is your top item needed? <eos> YOU: We really need water. <eos> THEM: Ok great, we have plenty of water and there is a lake nearby. You can have all 3 water. I would like to get 2 food packages.  <eos> YOU: Okay. I can agree to that if I can get 2 firewood. <eos> THEM: We are not in a very wooded area, I am not sure 1 firewood would be enough.  <eos> YOU: I can let you have 2 firewood. <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=3 item0=2 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

I would be willing to give you food for you activities in exchange for the water. I'm camping in a desert and there's no water sources out here. <eos> THEM: That is fine. So I take all the food you take all the water. Is that fine? <eos> YOU: Sounds good to me, and then we can split the firewood amongst us.  <eos> THEM: Yea. You are a good partner. Can I take 2 firewood I give you one <eos> YOU: I'd personally like 2 firewood because I don't have any extra food and will need to cook what I find. Firewood can help me cook and keep warm at night. What do you think? <eos> THEM: It is also very cold here and I have a condition triggered by cold weather. But we need to compromise. <eos> YOU: Hm. If I give you two firewood can I then have one of the food? That way you can keep warm, and I'll have some food to compensate for less firewood to keep warm and cook with.  <eos> THEM: No. Let me give you two firewood. I need as much food as I can find. <eos> YOU: Okay, that sounds fair to me! I understand you need food for your group!  <eos> THEM: I am glad to have you as my partner. have fun . <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </partner_input>

Can we share a portion of all 3? <eos> YOU: Yes, I was thinking I could take two water, two food, and one firewood. <eos> THEM: What is more important to you food or water? and why <eos> YOU: Water, because I need to drink more than I eat. <eos> THEM: I am a bit on the older side, I do not eat much food, water is important to me as well <eos> YOU: I see, and how important is the firewood to you? <eos> THEM: Well being on the older side, it may be difficult for me to chop and collect firewood, it is most important to me <eos> YOU: Alright, do you have an offer you want to make to me? <eos> THEM: I could take all 3 firewood if you perhaps want all the food? <eos> YOU: I need water most, so how about I take 2 water, all the food, and let you have all the firewood? <eos> THEM: Can you throw in 1 food for me? <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

You can have the rest. <eos> THEM: I was thinking the same for myself. I am really sensitive to the heat so water is essential for me so that I don't pass out <eos> YOU: I understand that completely, but I have kidney disease so I need the extra water for my kidneys to function properly. <eos> THEM: I think we need to assign more value to the water so we can get an even value. Whoever gets the two waters should get one food and one firewood. that seems only fair <eos> YOU: I agree that the water has higher value.  I'll take 2 waters and the one food and one firewood.  Do you agree with that since I have the medical condition? <eos> THEM: I'll give you an option to consider. You can use the firewood to boil water at the campsite to make it useable. So either option works for me. To be clear we are deciding between option A 2 water, 1 food and 1 firewood and option b 1 water 2 food and 2 firewood. I am ok with either <eos> YOU: I really need the extra water, so I'll take option A.   <eos> THEM: ok I'll take B and we have a deal <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hi - I'm so excited for our camping trip.  I'm most excited about getting to eat food that I normally don't when I am home. <eos> YOU: Hello! camper, how are you? I need us to make a deal where we all benefit. <eos> THEM: I agree - I really love food.  If I don't get it, I get hangry .  If you're ok with me getting all the food, I think I can make it with just one firewood and one water. <eos> YOU: What do you think if in the camp we get together and hold a meeting between your family and mine. We can have a small party so that we get to know each other better. <eos> THEM: That sounds like an excellent idea.  I love meeting and getting to know others. <eos> YOU: My main objective for the camp is also food, since I have a large family and the amount of food they give in the camp is very small for my whole family. <eos> THEM: I can do without one of the food, so maybe I can get 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water? <eos> YOU: I do not like the deal very much, but for that we must talk and decide as adults a good deal for both of us. What we want is to enjoy in the camp. <eos> THEM: Agreed - I enjoy camping.  A big part of that for me is that I get to eat food.  If I don't eat, I don't enjoy it so camping is basically a buffet for me.  I am pretty dead set on having at least two packages of food.  I can negotiate the water and firewood. <eos> YOU: How many members are there in your family group? To make a proposal taking into account the food you need according to your family group. <eos> THEM: I have me, my wife, and my four kids.  They are all teenagers.  You know how they go through food . <eos> YOU: Before making a deal I like to talk to people, to get to know them better. And if we are going to make a proposal for a party between the two families in the camp, it is in our best interest to know each other better. <eos> THEM: Understood, but I don't know anything about you.  I've offered a lot of information about me.  This is a two-way street.    <eos> YOU: My family is made up of my wife, my five children and me. All my children are minors, but they eat too much. When they don't eat they get very restless. <eos> THEM: I think one teenage kid is equivalent to young children.  The least I'm willing to accept is 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water.  I don't see another option as you haven't provided me any.  Let me know so we can get on our own camping trips. <eos> YOU: Ok, my proposal is to give you everything you need for food, because you have given me good reasons, on the condition that you give me everything I need for water and firewood. Because I can take some food to cook in the camp and I need a lot of firewood and water. <eos> THEM: What is your proposal.  Everything meaning you get 3 firewood and 3 water is not going to work for me.  Let me know. <eos> YOU: My proposal is to give you 2 foods, 1 water and 1 wood. I need water and firewood to cook in the camp. Unless you want 2 for water, 2 for reading, and 1 for food? <eos> THEM: No thanks - I don't think we're going to come to a deal.  I hope you enjoy your camping trip. <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: Reject-Deal <eos> YOU: Reject-Deal <eos> YOU: I can offer you this other treatment: 3 Food, 0 Firewood and 1 Water. I'm giving you all the food. What does it say? <eos> THEM: I'm going to go ahead and walk away from this deal.  I think it's not going to work for us so I wish you, your spouse, and five children a ton of fun on your camping trip. <eos>  </dialogue> <output> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

Do you have any need for food?  <eos> YOU: I am not that interested in food. I don't really have any desire for it. Do have a preference for food? <eos> THEM: I do need food, it is important to me.  <eos> YOU: Okay, would you say you like food or fire more? <eos> THEM: I like fire more, it is very important to me and then food is next in line. What do you think about water?  <eos> YOU: I like water. It is good, but not as good as fire. I think I am starting to understand where we are.  :) <eos> THEM: I like to have fire more than food and then water. Fire is the most important to me because I like to keep a fire burning all night long. I get scared of the dark :o :o and the fire makes it so that I am happy :) and content.  <eos> YOU: That is very reasonable. What about if you have some of all three? You could have 3 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood. <eos> THEM: I like having 3 of the food. However, I feel that having 2 firewood would be better for keeping my fire burning all night long   <eos> YOU: I could see that maybe you take all the food and I take all the water. How does that sound? Then the only thing we have to discuss is the firewood, right? <eos> THEM: <selection>YOU: Reject-Deal <eos> YOU: I have an idea. Do you have a coin? You flip the coin and if I guess correctly I get the 2 firewood. If I don't then you get the 2 firewood? <eos> THEM: Sure that works for me. I have flipped the coin.   <eos> YOU: Ok, I guess tails  <eos> THEM: you are correct.

Would you like to bring someone arbitrary to quartermaster our food? <eos> THEM: if you have three wood already, i need some of the extra supplies. <eos> YOU: Would you like to hold all three water, while I hold all 3 firewood and an arbitrary cook in our party holds 3 food??  <eos> THEM: I can agree to that deal <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=3 item2=0 item0=0 item1=0 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

Why do you need the water? <eos> YOU: We are planning a family hike,which would require more water rather than food. <eos> THEM: We are also planning a hike. But I could get by with 1 water if you would let us have 1 firewood? <eos> YOU: Awesome! I can do that! You can definitely have 1 firewood if you will let me have 2 waters. <eos> THEM: So to confirm, I would get 3 food/1 water/1 firewood and you would get 2 firewood and 2 waters? <eos> YOU: If I can have 1 food, 1 firewood, and 2 waters, would you be willing to take 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water? <eos> THEM: I'll take that as a deal!  <eos> YOU: Great, thank you! My kids will thank you for the supplies!  <eos> THEM: No problem!

Thus, the need to exchange have we have, water, for the much needed food. <eos> YOU: Oh i am sorry to say we have a large family as well with growing children and a breastfeeding mom. We will have to work out the food situation.  <eos> THEM: How about I include some firewood? Remember you have the basic food in your arsenal. I would just like to exchange for the extra you have. <eos> YOU: Yes i know, as you should take that into consideration as well. You said you dont need water so lets agree on me having 3 and you can have all the firewood.  <eos> THEM: Not even to spare a package of food?  <eos> YOU: No i think i can take 2 food, 3 water, 0 firewood.  <eos> THEM: Food is my most essential as well. A package is not enough for us <eos> YOU: As i said we are a family of the same size. I can give you 2 but thats it, in exchange i would like 2 fire wood as we will need to hunt. So you get 2 food, 0 water, 1 firewood <eos> THEM: Lets make it 2 food, 1 water, 1 firewood <eos> YOU: Sure that sounds fair <eos> THEM: ok <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

Hopefully we can divide them up fairly! <eos> YOU: I'm sure we can make a deal. I know I need firewood and food, water is less of a priority.  <eos> THEM: Ah firewood and water and bigger priorities for me (firewood especially), but food is not a concern for me <eos> YOU: Firewood is especially a priority for me. I'd be willing to sacrifice some water in exchange for more firewood packages.  <eos> THEM: Ideally, I'd like to get my hands on as much firewood as possible. My son has a blood disease which makes it difficult for him to stay warm at night  <eos> YOU: I would as well. I'm camping in an area with no brush/trees, I need to make sure I have enough to stay alive during the night. If you bring less firewood do you think you could find some where you're camping? <eos> THEM: I doubt it. We're camping primarily in a tundra with little burnable vegetation. Perhaps we can come to an agreement were you receive more supplies in total, and I take a little more firewood? <eos> YOU: I would be up for that as long as I can get at least get 1 firewood package. My next priority would be food, would you be willing to give me all the packages of food and I'll give you the water? <eos> THEM: I think that sounds very fair. I'll take 2 firewood (thank you!), and you take 1 firewood. You take all 3 food and I'll take all 3 water. <eos> YOU: Whoops, I didn't realize. I'd still like to have 1 water just in case, and because you'll have more of the firewood which was both of our priority. Do you think that would still be fair? <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

We have a big group and are really going to need these supplies.  <eos> YOU: Hey. I definitely agree to the 2 waters! However, the other terms won't really work for me. My friend and I tend to get low blood sugar and while we have other supplies, we would like to have some extra food, so would like at least 1 food from the extra supplies. Also, how about 1 firewood? Would that still leave your group with enough? <eos> THEM: We have a really big group of folks who are really fat so we can't part with the food.  <eos> YOU: I totally understand where you're coming from. My group is a little smaller, so I think I would be okay with your group taking all 3 food. <eos> THEM: Oh that would be very kind of you. Would you be ok with taking 1 firewood possibly?  <eos> YOU: Yeah I would be fine with that. I mainly want it so we can have extra to keep away bugs and other animals mainly at night. So, 1 firewood would work for us. <eos> THEM: Oh you are a very kind negotiator.  <eos> YOU: Thanks!  You're also being really understanding. Are you still okay with my group taking 2 water? <eos> THEM: Yes that is fine with me.

What if I give you two packages of water?  <eos> YOU: I really need all three, since I do a lot of hiking.  I was thinking I get all the water, I'll give you 2 of the firewood and two of the food. <eos> THEM: I need water too.  <eos> YOU: Hmmm, okay.  How bout you get one water, two firewood, and one food? <eos> THEM: If we do that then you will get five packages of items, while I only have 4. That's not fair. How about I get 2 firewood, 1 water and 2 food.  <eos> YOU: That sounds fair to me.

I need a lot of extra firewood because I'm having a big bonfire.  What kind of supplies do you most need? <eos> THEM: We are going as a large  group, so food is what we need most. But we are also going to need lots of wood, since it may get cold. <eos> YOU: Ok, are you guys going to need extra water?  We will definitely need some extra, in case we have dishes.  <eos> THEM: We wont need much extra water. We plan to drink mainly alcohol.  <eos> YOU: I'd like 2 packages of fire wood and 3 packages of water.  Then you would get 1 pack of wood and 3 packages of food.  What to you think <eos> THEM: I would like 3 packages of food, 1  packages of wood and 1 package of water <eos> YOU: I really need at least 2 packages of wood.  My bon fire will be huge.  How would you feel if I took two packages of wood and then two packs of water.  That would leave you with 3 food, 1 water, and 1 wood <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

I am a diabetic and need to keep my blood sugar up.  <eos> YOU: Gotcha, we can work on that. Any interest in firewood as well? <eos> THEM: Well I have interest in all of the items but food is most important.  I would like some more wood as I am small and tend to get cold at night.  What is your highest need item? <eos> YOU: My biggest need is water, it's going to be incredibly hot hot where I'm going so I'm looking for as much as possible. Also, hence the need for not a whole lot of firewood. <eos> THEM: I have the least need for water so I'd be happy to give you the water and I'll take the wood if that's of no use to you. <eos> YOU: That's perfect, I'd like 1 of the food if possible. However seems like you need the extra bag more than I do. <eos> THEM: That sounds like a good deal to me! <eos> YOU: Great so 3 waters to me, 3 firewood to you and 1 food for me, 2 for you? <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=1 item2=3 item0=3 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>
<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hello how are you doing today? <eos> YOU: I'm good, how are you? <eos> THEM: I am alright, thinking about camping and the time we went camping by the beach in Indiana. You ever camped near a beach? <eos> YOU: Unfortunately no, but I would love to experience camping, I bet it's a lot of fun. <eos> THEM: It is but you really should not set up a tent on sand. One of my friends tried and it was not good. A lot of bugs in the sand and they didn't even use a tarp. <eos> YOU: I will take note of that, that's a good thing to consider. How about the things that are needed for camping, what do you think would be the best decision? <eos> THEM: Depends where you are camping. One trip I did during the summer was during extreme heat and most important thing was water. If you are camping in the woods firewood might be low because there is wood all around you. <eos> YOU: Yeah, that makes sense. I agree that the most important is water regardless of where you are camping because you don't know if there is water where you are going, and if there is you don't know if it is safe for drinking. <eos> THEM: I have done winter camping and there was fresh water you could drink as long as you boiled it, but firewood was hard to find as most on the ground was rotted. <eos> YOU: In situation like that, where you have idea of the situation, I think it is important to balance of what extra things that might be needed. <eos> THEM: Would you be open to letting me get 2 waters and I can take 1 of the food and firewood? <eos> YOU: I think that is a reasonable decision, I agree with your choices. <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

I really need the extra food, so I was hoping to take three of the food as well as three of the firewood. <eos> THEM: Hi there.  Well we are making smoores and really need to start a fire.  The firewood is most important to us.   <eos> YOU: Oh no, that's what we need it for, too. I've been telling my daughter about how my dad used to take me camping and taught me to make s'mores. She's so excited! What if we split the firewood? <eos> THEM: That sounds reasonable.  Your dad sounds like mine :)   Do you need water?  I'd be happy to let you have all 3 if we could get at least 2 of the firewood.   <eos> YOU: I'm pretty good on water, thanks.  How about I'll take one of the waters, three of the food, and only one of the firewood. You can have the other two waters and most of the firewood. <eos> THEM: We are very hungry and didn't bring any snacks.  We were hoping to get 2 of the food and 2 firewood.  We are good on water too.  What do you think?   <eos> YOU: I have two teenage boys with me and really need the food.  What if I take two food, one firewood, and two waters? That way we both get our fair share of what's important.   <eos> THEM: I thought you were good on water?  Could we take 2 waters, 2 firewood and 1 food?   <eos> YOU: Oh, earlier you said that I could have all three waters if you could have two firewood, so I assumed you didn't any. But I can totally let you have it.  So I'll take two food, one firewood, and one water. <eos> THEM: That's great thanks.

I can give you 2 firewood and 1 water but I also need 2 food packages because I get hungry quickly. <eos> YOU: I am happy to give you 2 food packages and take just 1. But I am really hoping that you would let me have 3 firewoods. I am also very afraid of dark and would have to keep fire going all night long.  <eos> THEM: I really think I need two firewood packages because I was ill.  If I had not been sick recently it would be ok to let you have them all.  I will do my best to get along with one package of firewood.     <eos> YOU: I understand your fear. How about if I offer you more water? You could take 2 waters?  <eos> THEM: Ordinarily I would be ok with that but this time I do need one package of firewood.  I <eos> YOU: You mentioned that you get very hungry easily. What if you took all of the food? I usually can tolerate being hungry for longer periods of time but I really fear being in the dark at some point without fire going and no light.  <eos> THEM: Maybe another time that would work but I do need the firewood.  You will have two packages of firewood and Im sure that you will be fine.  I wouldnt leave a burning fire on at night while sleeping, it could be very dangerouss. <eos> YOU: I have done that before and I am used to that way as I take additional precautions to secure fireplace. If we do not come to conclusion soon, we will both end up getting less..  <eos> THEM: That is possible, I still need the one package of firewood though.  An unattended fire is dangerous in the woods. <eos> YOU: So then you would be ok with 1 firewood, 1 water and 2 foods? <eos> THEM: Yes would work, <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>

I am a little concerned about how chilly it's going to be outside. I want to make sure it's warm enough. I could really use 3 extra packages of firewood.  <eos> YOU: I love sitting around the fire as well. I feel like you can never have enough firewood. It's also a great protector against anything that may be lurking around. <eos> THEM: Yes exactly. It's really important for a good camping experience. We currently have a foster child with us and they have never been camping, so I want to give them the best experience because he deserves it!  <eos> YOU: Wow that is so awesome! I hope they have the best time. I have some firewood I'm able to provide to you. Is 2 packages okay? <eos> THEM: I would maybe be able to get by with 2. If I could get 2 more packages of food that doesn't need to be cooked over a fire. Another package of water would also helpful since I won't be able to boil as much over the fire.  <eos> YOU: I could definitely give you 2 packages of firewood! My family goes through water like crazy! My son and his father both drink like a fish. And food! I swear they eat me out of the house. Now that I'm thinking, if I could get 2 packages of water and a package of food, I could provide you with the 3 extra firewood packages I have! If that works for you? <eos> THEM: So let me see if we are on the same page here. I would get 3 firewood 2 food, and no water? <eos> YOU: If that is okay. I know you need the firewood more than anything else. We definitely need more water. <eos> THEM: I would appreciate that so much.

<input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: Hey neighbor. I bet you're looking forward to your camping trip, as am I! Looks like we should divide up the remaining supplies between us. What's most important to you? <eos> THEM: Yeah! I am ok with that, we can divide the remaining supplies between us. <eos> YOU: Well let's start with food first. Food's pretty important to me, since I'll be camping in a remote area without much access to food. How would you feel about letting me have all 3 of those? <eos> THEM: Food is very important for me too, for me to survive over there I would need food too. I would give you half of it. <eos> YOU: Hmm food seems important to both of us. How do you feel about firewood and water? <eos> THEM: There is a saying that water does not have enemy. I would need water for domestic use and I would need firewood in other to keep myself warm and as a source of energy in the night. <eos> YOU: Ah then it sounds like we want all of the same things then, but we must sacrifice something for the good of everyone. What is more of a priority for you, firewood or food? <eos> THEM: Both are very important to me, but I would likely go for food, food is more important <eos> YOU: Understood completely. I'm interested in food more than firewood as well. How would you feel if I took 2 Food, 1 Firewood, and all 3 Waters? <eos> THEM: The food you took is much, please take 1 food, 2 firewood and 2 water <eos> YOU: I think food is the tricky one here. How about this: you take ALL the firewood, and I'll take all the water. Would you be willing to let me have 2 food then? <eos> THEM: Take 1 food, you take all the firewood and 1 water. Let's do it like that <eos> YOU: That's a non-starter unfortunately. I'd be willing to let you have 2 food if you give me 1 firewood. You get 2 food and 2 firewood, and I get what's left. <eos> THEM: I think I am ok with the 2 food and the 1 firewood. You can get what is left. Thank you <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=3 item0=2 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>
<input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </input> <dialogue> THEM: I would like you to have the extra food because we have a high need for water. <eos> YOU: Sure that works for me! I'd like extra firewood so that we can ward off any wild animals and so we can see that night. And to roast marshmallows around a campfire :D <eos> THEM: Sounds good however my camping buddy is unusually thin and gets chilled quickly. I am hoping the extra food will be worth two firewoods for us. You can still roast marshmellos with the wood you already have. <eos> YOU: If your camping buddy is unusually thin, I feel like it'll be best for you folks to have more food. I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of food for more water instead. How about you guys take 2 units of food and I'll keep one? Eating food will help you stay warm since your body temperature goes up <eos> THEM: That is a good idea! We can give you a water and your can give us a food. I will encourage him to eat because he has weight problems. Are you otherwise okay with our distribution? <eos> YOU: Awesome, I'm glad we can agree on that :D Since I'm not getting any extra food, is it possible for me to have more firewood? Having just water isn't going to be able to sustain us, I'll need the firewood to cook some fish that we'll need to catch on our own  <eos> THEM: How about you have 2 firewood units, 1 water, and 1 food. We can wrap up if we get cold. Oh, and good luck fishing! <eos> YOU: Hey, that sounds fantastic! :D I'm all about being one with nature and enjoying what the wilderness has to offer lol.  <eos> THEM: Camping is great and I am glad you do not have to depend on your fishing to eat. It looks like we are in agreement with the extra provisions. Just check the chart to be sure I did it as we agreed! <eos> YOU: Sure thing! I hope you two have a wonderful camping trip!

I hope to make my family a delicious meal.  <eos> YOU: Sure no problem; how much firewood do you need? <eos> THEM: Food is more of a priority but two of them and one water would be good I think <eos> YOU: I understand you completely. What exactly were you planning to make with these items? <eos> THEM: I will be making some flame grilled steak.  <eos> YOU: That sounds very yummy. Is there a particular reason you want to make that dish? <eos> THEM: No I just think of myself as a chef so I like to make cool dishes.  <eos> YOU: Oh that's nice.  How badly would you need these items? <eos> THEM: What's with the angry face? I need my two food and firewood items very badly.  <eos> YOU: Does my face look angry? Nah, it is just your impression.

Have you ever camped during the winter? <eos> THEM: No i haven't, usually only in the warmer weather due to my age and limitations. What does it remind you of? <eos> YOU: Well I went camping in the winter before and we needed to bring lots of firewood to keep warm. Also water was near by but needed to be boiled. <eos> THEM: I understand. Firewood would be crucial with the cold and the need to boil water to drink. How about you take 2 of the 3 firewood supplies then <eos> YOU: That sounds good, would you want 2 of the food and waters then? <eos> THEM: I need more of the water as i battle kidney issues, are you good with only 1 of the food, do you hunt? <eos> YOU: I have done some fishing in the past that is fun. Ice fishing is interesting. I can give you all the waters. <eos> THEM: That would be very kind and generous, so you take 2 firewood, 1 food and how about 1 water just to be fair, deal? <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=0 item0=1 item1=2 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

Hope all well and let's begin with our requirements. <eos> YOU: I'd really like extra firewood, my kids like to make lots of s'mores. <eos> THEM: Well, I can manage with it. I would need more food in that case. <eos> YOU: That's OK, although water is the thing I need least of. My teenages eat a lot but only drink flavored beverages :/ <eos> THEM: So, can I have 2 packages of food. <eos> YOU: If I can have all the firewood, you can have 2 packages of food yes. <eos> THEM: Hmm ok  I thought I can have 1 of firewood in case of emergency. What about 2-1 of food and 1-2 of firewood. <eos> YOU: That might work, but how do you feel about the water? I may actually need it for making tea and coffee. Can I get 2 water also? <eos> THEM: Yes, that's fine <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </partner_input>
<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: Hi! I prefer to acquire firewood for cooking and water for hiking long trails. <eos> THEM: Hello! I really need water myself--I didn't bring enough to go hiking, and it's going to be hotter than I planned for. And I really wanted to go on a long hike  How about this: I get all the water, and you can have all the firewood? I don't need firewood so much, really. <eos> YOU: I really like hiking also, as i have a habit of running a lot. So i would give extra firewood and food for extra water. <eos> THEM: Okay, how about this: you get all the firewood and one water, and I get two water? <eos> YOU: For two water I will give all food and one firewood <eos> THEM: No, thanks. I really need water a lot, and I don't want firewood all that much. <eos> YOU: Okay, I like your previous deal!  <eos> THEM: Cool! So, 3 firewood for you and 1 water, 2 water for me; how should we split the food? <eos> YOU: I keep all food. <eos> THEM: Okay, that doesn't work for me, because that means you get 7 items and I get 2. <eos> YOU: Okay, well I'll give 1 food <eos> THEM: Give me 2 food and we'll have a deal. <eos> YOU: Again.3 food and 1 firewood for 2 water <eos> THEM: If I don't get at least 4 items total, I'm walking. <eos> YOU: Okay 2 water for 3 food and 2 firewood <eos> THEM: How about I get 2 water and 2 food, you get 3 firewood and 2 food? <eos> YOU: Fine.

<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hi! I'm super excited to go camping with my family, especially since we haven't been able to get out of the house due to Covid. Are you going camping too? <eos> YOU: Yes I am! I'm going camping way up north so it's going to be super super cold. Is it okay if I take all the firewood? <eos> THEM: Super cold up north? Its August right now. Are you going to be ok? Should you also take water and food? <eos> YOU: Even though it's August it can actually get pretty cold at night. Currently it's 70 where I live and that's at noon when it's the warmest! And no, I don't need as much water for example because my mom stockpiled it all during COVID.  <eos> THEM: So you plan to be sleeping outside instead of in a tent?We're planning on doing a lot of fishing and we want to cook the fish we catch over a campfire every night... <eos> YOU: I'll definitely be sleeping inside...but my family loves sitting around the campfire late into the night. We normally don't sleep a lot when camping haha. How about I take 2 Firewood, and you take 1. I can offer you more food to make up for the fish tho!  <eos> THEM: Mmmm... I dunno... I've packed food for "just in case" but we're really planning moreso to cook the fish we catch than pack more food. My husband wants to do this trail where we hike along the perimeter of the lake and set up camp every night <eos> YOU: Could you then offer a deal? I'm getting impatient and will leave soon. I'm thinking 2 firewood for me and 1 for you. And 2 food for you and 1 for me. If it makes you happy you can also have 2 water.  <eos> THEM: Sorry, I've got other things to do in addition to this negotiation. And I don't really have a grasp on how important these resources are you to you and why I should give in to your demands. <eos> YOU: Well then offer a counterdeal! I don't understand what you want me to do if you're not giving options lol <eos> THEM: <selection>YOU: Reject-Deal <eos> THEM: Reject-Deal <eos> THEM: I thought you wanted firewood so badly, that's why I proposed the previous deal. I originally wanted firewood but since you're being so rude, I figured I'd give in to your selfish demand and offer all of the firewood to you. <eos> YOU: I don't appreciate the rude tone. I thank you for that, but you're still getting more out of the deal than I am . If I could just have 1 additional water I would be satisfied! And according to my calculations, you come out on the better side!  <eos> THEM: I know you don't appreciate it because its not what you want to hear.  If I give you 1 water, it does not come out with me on the better side, I'm worse off. <eos>  </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>
<input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: So I was thinking I'd take 2 waters and only 1 of the firewood and food. <eos> YOU: Would you be open to doing that the other way around? <eos> THEM: I don't know.  I really don't think I have enough water to cover all the hiking.  I could definitely use extra.   <eos> YOU: Yeah, I'm in the same boat, I'm one of those types that is overly cautious and like having as much water as possible, just in case. <eos> THEM: Hm.  Well what about firewood?  How are you with that?   <eos> YOU: I could do with or without a fire, it's not a top priority like food and water <eos> THEM: Well I have trouble with starting fires, so the extra firewood would be beneficial to me...I know I'll need a fire going each night.  So what if I took all 3 firewood and then you could have the majority of the water? <eos> YOU: so you would get 1 water, 1 food and 3 firewood? <eos> THEM: I would be interested in negotiating for a little more food in that case, but yes, otherwise that is what I am proposing.  <eos> YOU: well, that would put you at 6 items and me at 3 <eos> THEM: Well you didn't really need the firewood right?  I, on the other hand, could use all of it.  If I'm willing to take only 1 food package, are you good with the deal? <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>
<input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </input> <dialogue> YOU: Hi - I see we are looking to make a trade before our camping trip  <eos> THEM: Yes, that's right! And I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that's good for both of us. <eos> YOU: What do you prefer to trade with the most? <eos> THEM: I'd like at least 1 firewood and 2 waters. The water especially because I only have 1 jug of water, and I don't want to get dehydrated with all the hiking I'm going to do. What do you prefer most? <eos> YOU: I also don't want to get dehydrated as my spouse likes to call me a water buffalo with the amount of water I consume.  I am willing to forgo the firewood if I can get 3 food and 3 waters.  <eos> THEM: Ha! That's hilarious. I love it. I can do with just 1 water, then, but I'm going to need at least 1 food, too. I burn calories so quickly that I'm getting hungry just in this chat.:)  <eos> YOU: Ok, if you need 1 of each food and water, can I get 1 firewood?  That would make me 1 firewood, 2 food, and 2 water.  you:  2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water? <eos> THEM: Hmmm, I don't know. I really need that firewood. It's gonna be cold, so I need all of the firewood I can get to keep warm. Last time I went camping without, it was miserable. Felt like I was going to shiver to death.  Is that one a necessity for you? <eos> YOU: That one is if I can't keep warm with my food.  I think it would be ok if I got the extra food.   Otherwise, I run on empty with no warm food to eat and then no firewood to keep me warm .  How about me:  3 food, 1 water, no firewood then? <eos> THEM: Okay, I'd be willing to go for that, and thanks for understanding! That works for you as well? <eos> YOU: Sorry, I meant to say 3 food, 2 waters.....  My apologies - see that's where my lack of water gets me....all confused and bothered  <eos> THEM: Ha! That's a good one. Okay, you drive a hard bargain, but 3 foods and 2 waters to you, the rest to me. That sound good?

<input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello, hope you are well. more than anything i need extra firewood as looks like going to be extra cold on my camping trip. what are you needing the most? <eos> THEM: I am also going to need firewood the most. I would be willing to give extra food for it. <eos> YOU: i bought a lot of extra food. but what about if you get 2 firewood and then 1 water and food. and i get 1 firewood and 2 water and 2 food? <eos> THEM: That's not bad, but I would rather have 2 firewood, 2 water and 1 food. <eos> YOU: i hear ya but water is my 2nd biggest need after firewood as will be doing a lot of hiking so can't really get by with just 1 of my top 2 needs in firewood and water. only way could do that is if received all the food. <eos> THEM: I think that may be an acceptable deal but I would need to eat something so I don't know if I would be able to give all of the food to you. I still think 1 firewood and 1 water and two food is a good deal for you. I need the extra water to take my medicines with in the morning. <eos> YOU: i think whoever gets 2 firewood should only get 1 water as that only seems fair. would you take only 1 firewood and 1 water if those your top 2 needs? <eos> THEM: I may be able to give you all three of the food if you let me have 2 firewood and 2 water, other than that I may have to end this negotiation. <eos> YOU: good grief. i need food the least. how bout you get 2 firewood, 1 water, and 2 food. so you get more of your top need and 5 items overall. i will take 1 firewood, 2 water, and 1 food. 1 get 4 items and 2 of my 2nd most need? way more than fair to you. sound good? <eos> THEM: Do you wonder what my top needs are at all? Apparently not. I guess this negotiation is going nowhere. <eos> YOU: you told me this after i asked....I am also going to need firewood the most. I would be willing to give extra food for it. <eos> THEM: I would be willing to get 2 firewood and 1 water an 1 food so you are happy and end up with the most things. As long as I get the firewood. I guess I will have to go without my medicine. <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

I love to have all firewood but I cannot live through this without food. I get hungry often and need to eat many times throughout the day. I would like to have food as well. <eos> YOU: what if I give you one food and all the wood and one water, so I can have two food and two waters? <eos> THEM: That seems reasonable enough to me. Would you consider at all giving me more food?  <eos> YOU: I think that offer is pretty good. we got four items each <eos> THEM: It does seem fair at the end of the day. I just wished to get more food . <eos> YOU:  I know, food is never really too much. but I really need the two portions of food  <eos> THEM: I understand because I really need firewood the most as I get very cold and freeze easily, and I would have to burn it throughout night because I am scared of dark <eos> YOU: then we got ourselves a deal. so 2 food and two water for me, right? <eos> THEM: That sounds good. <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>

You need to consider me too. <eos> YOU: You are taking almost everything. I can offer you 1 water, 2 food and 1 firewood. It is fair. <eos> THEM: It's not fair. That means you take most of almost everything. Can i take 3 food, 1 water and 1 firewood? <eos> YOU: I also need food please <eos> THEM: Okay then. What if i give you 1 food and you give me another water? I have a condition that requires a lot of water. <eos> YOU: With water, I can not do with less than 2 water. then i can give you 2 food and 2 firewood.

If i get two i will share it with you we can ration it  <eos> YOU: This is something we will have to work on, how about we can share 2-1? <eos> THEM: I will need 2 and give you one. I am willing to pass on the fire wood meaning. I get 2 packages of water and you get access to it an emergency. <eos> YOU: In that case, I will need more of food. <eos> THEM: that could work 2-1 for food; fire wood could be shared I know how to store it incase of rain and am a skilled out doors man.  <eos> YOU: What are your thoughts on how to share firewood? <eos> THEM: I am a skilled outdoorsmen If you let me hold all the firewood I would be able to perserve it.  <eos> YOU: Appreciate it. But, it's not advisable to rely on skills, we never know what situation can we expect? <eos> THEM: Thats true--But I am concerned about you if something happens to me you may not be able to utlise it. Maybe you could but I think we would both benfit if I held all the fire wood that way I could teach you some tricks. <eos> YOU: That is so nice of you to be concerned of me. But, yes, I need to think of the food as well and would need firewood. <eos> THEM: Yeah I agree that you could hold the food 2-1 that way there is a system of checks and balances. <eos> YOU: Hmm..this is between thinking of the present and future. My reasoning is concerning the present. <eos> THEM: agreed but like you never know what situation we can expect. you control the food and have intrest and acess to the water with me holding the firewood  <eos> YOU: No, that would be unfair to you..My suggestion is to we will either decide on water or Food and firewood. Like 2-1 of the former and 1-2 of the latter. <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=1 item0=3 item1=1 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

Since we are all Chefs, its a great relaxing experience for us.  <eos> THEM: With that in mind, how would you like to divvy up these extra supplies?  <eos> YOU: We would love to have extra food, since we love to cook. that being said, we will need a  fair bit of firewood too, to keep the fire going strong. you? <eos> THEM: Firewood is very important to me.  Water is something I'll need too, since I sweat a lot.  <eos> YOU: Water we don't need much of. Just Food and Firewood <eos> THEM: Firewood is important to me too.

I don't really love the outdoors too much  <eos> THEM: oh, okay, well will be hiking and could use all 3 waters <eos> YOU: Well I know that I can go without water for a little, but knowing how hot the weather is supposed to be this week I could really use the water, as well.  I would be okay with me taking a water and you taking two since you will be doing physical exercise. <eos> THEM: great, you can have all the food and i'll take all the firewood? <eos> YOU: Or, we could split those as well.  I was thinking about splitting the firewood two to one so that I could definitely stay warm.  I would want to stay up around the fire probably all night so I would much prefer having more of that. <eos> THEM: i would prefer 2 firewood and 1 food. we will be catching fish to eat <eos> YOU: Well the firewood is how we are going to make our food. <eos> THEM: ok, so I'll take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food? <eos> YOU: Sounds good to me!

Can't wait to get out there and get started. All that remains is dividing up these final items. Is there anything in aprticular you're itching to get your hands on? <eos> THEM: My kids eat a lot, so food is the priority. Everything after food plays second to that. You? <eos> YOU: I'm building a mighty bonfire to honor my pagan god, so extra firewood is ideal for me!  Having extra water on hand would also be a plus in case the flames get out of control. <eos> THEM: That's pretty exciting. There are 9 parcels to agree on. I would be comfortable making as near a split as can be given our preferences and values. <eos> YOU: Well it seems like Firewood is most important to me, and Food is most important to you. I think You taking all the Food and me taking all the Firewood is a good starting point. That just leaves us with dividing up the Water. <eos> THEM: Agreed. Water is usually plentiful, so we are not as worried for finding it to drink. I would defer to you on the plus end of water. Say 2:1? <eos> YOU: Very generous of you!  I think we've come up with a good deal. You take 3 Food and 1 Water, I take the remainder. <eos> THEM: I would take that deal. <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=0 item2=2 item0=0 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

What supplies would you require? <eos> THEM: well i am kinda scared of height so is a no no for me. i need like 3 fire woods, 2 waters and just a food will be okay for me. <eos> YOU: I do need more water, since hiking takes a physical toll. So, could I get 2 water and 1 Food and 1 Firewood? <eos> THEM: well sounds reasonable but can i get 2 fire woods 2 water and 1 food <eos> YOU: How about 3 firewood and 2 water? <eos> THEM: okay that is a deal <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=3 item2=1 item0=3 item1=0 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

I am taking a group of 40 kids camping, lots of work on my end. I was wondering, if its okay with you, will it be okay if I get all 3 waters? the needs of children differ from adults, I feel. the amount of water being spilled will be tremendous. I also need the extra supplies, for cooking, cleaning, and putting out camp fire, I am willing to give you 3 foods in exchange? what are your thoughts? <eos> THEM: Well I was really hoping to get some Water as well, would you be willing to part with 1 Water for 1 food? <eos> YOU: So sorry I completely understand, If i was in your shoes I would also would want the extra water. will you be okay if I gave you 2 firewood and 3 foods for all 3 waters? So sorry, I really need the water,  <eos> THEM: I feel like that still has me giving up a lot by not taking any extra water. Would you be willing to sacrifice all the firewood? <eos> YOU: I understand, believe me. may I ask how many camp members are coming along? children? or are you camping alone? <eos> THEM: Its me, my wife, and my son camping. I understand your need for the extra water, but I have almost no need for the extra firewood.  <eos> YOU: I understand, i will feel horrible if your child needed the extra water. I am willing to give you a water. I am in need of Firewood and I have sufficient Food for all of my 40 kids. Will it be okay If i get 2 fire woods and you get 2 foods? <eos> THEM: 1 Water, 2 food, and 1 firewood works for me. <eos> YOU: Perfect! I will be getting 2 waters, 2 FW, and 1 food. Since you were so nice and understood my need. I am willing to give you all of my food. That way it feels you are getting a better deal <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

I also am trying to collect extra water and food to take care of the orphaned bears I came across near the camp site <eos> THEM: Orphaned bears huh? Well, maybe if you could help freed some of the humans I'll be with we could share some with the bears. What if we get 2 food, 1 water, and 2 firewood for the humans? <eos> YOU: hmmm I don't know about that. If you think that is a good deal, then let's reverse it so the bears can get what you suggest. The bears thank you! <eos> THEM: I think the humans would be ok with 1 food, 2 water, and 3 firewood if the bears are really hungry <eos> YOU: I see you are quite the negotiator. How about this? You can have 3 waters and 1 firewood and we'll call it even! <eos> THEM: that's not really even. You're getting all of the food which we both need the most. so I'll take 3 waters and 2 firewood. <eos> YOU: ok, well if you think what I offered was not even, I will take 3 waters and 1 firewood <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=0 item2=3 item0=2 item1=3 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

But I'm sure we can work something out. What about I take 1 food, 2 water and all firewood? <eos> THEM: That's a good deal, but I need a little bit  more firewood. What if I give you 1 food, all the water, and 2 firewood? <eos> YOU: That will work for me.  <eos> THEM: That sounds great!!   <eos> YOU: I'm glad we could come up with something that works for both of us  <eos> THEM: Me, I feel like this is a very fair deal and I hope we have fun on our camping trips. <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=3 item0=1 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

I am most interested in water.  What if you get 3 food and i get 3 water? <eos> THEM: That was exactly my thought process, the firewood is an issue though since there is no way to divide it evenly. <eos> YOU: yes, we'll have to split it!!  I'll have my kids with me and would love to have 2 firewood bundles to make sure they stay warm, but i don't want to be greedy! <eos> THEM: Unfortunately I am anemic so If I do not get 2 extra firewood the last portion of my trip would be dreadful. <eos> YOU: would you be willing to give up 1 bundle of food for 2 woods?  so you would get 2 food and 2 wood? <eos> THEM:  I simply cannot give up any food. I am sorry. <eos> YOU: darn!  ok let's say you get 3 food  and 2 wood, i take 3 water and 1 wood.   <eos> THEM:  Thank you, I think we can come to an agreement. I am sorry about your children.

My active kids will use a lot. <eos> YOU: We actually were trying to find room to lug our own water and sadly left every drop at home this year. <eos> THEM: In order for me to feel comfortable on this trip, I would really like to have 2 extra waters.  A couple of extra firewoods would be great also.  How about you? <eos> YOU: I'm sure we can reach an agreement since there are only three to split. There may be a different way to make ends meet. <eos> THEM: Like I said, I would really like to have 2 waters, 2 firewoods, and a food just in case.  What are your feelings on this? <eos> YOU: It's not ideal because we need the same supplies, actually. We have a few extra guests coming and we would like to feed them all. <eos> THEM: So exactly what supplies and how many are looking to get?  I told you what I need. <eos> YOU: Do you have a larger car? Perhaps you could take all the firewood, and I will take all the food. <eos> THEM: I could let you have all the food if I can have all the firewood and 2 waters. <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=3 item2=1 item0=3 item1=0 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

I get cold at night and did not bring enough apparently. <eos> YOU: I'm willing to let you take the 3 firewood if you let me have the 3 food. <eos> THEM: I would be happy with that. How are you doing on water? I could use a bit of that myself. <eos> YOU: Would you be okay with taking 1 water? I really need extra because my family and I are going for a hike. <eos> THEM: Any chance you will come across a stream during your hike to fill water bottles? I don't plan to hike so won't have a chance to do any refills. <eos> YOU: You make an excellent point. I should get at least 1 water to be able to last us until we get to a stream. <eos> THEM: I would be happy with that. We can do 3 Firewood for me and 2 water.

It is hot in the day, and we will be doing some rockclimbing and hiking.  There is no firewood out there to collect or buy, so I'm hoping to take the firewood and water. <eos> YOU: That is a bummer since i was hoping for more firewood as well, i am really afraid of wild animals so i will need a big fire <eos> THEM:  Yes, wild animals can be a problem in some locales. I suggest an effective spray and carrying a knife at all times. I am willing to part with one firewood if I can secure the three waters.  Does this work for you? <eos> YOU: I was really hoping for more firewood and water than that, how about you get two firewoods and two waters and i get the rest of the items? Or the other way around would work as well for me? <eos> THEM: Sorry, that won't work for me.  Are you able to collect wood where you are camping?  I am afraid that I don't want to budge on the firewood, with one exception.  Without the extra firewood, we would probably need more food that doesn't need to be cooked.  I could give up the two firewood and take three waters and two food. <eos> YOU: If you will take three waters and two foods that would work for me, that way you get five items to my four. <eos> THEM:  No, firewood is my highest priority.  If I give up the firewood, I would like all the food and water.   <eos> YOU: That would make it 6 to 3 as far as the items go, how about i get 1 firewood and 3 foods, i am taking a loss but that really is as low as i can go <eos> THEM: I can accept that.   <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

In my case, I would really like to have 2 water, 2 firewood, and 1 food.

I have a kidney disorder where I have to drink a ton of water every day. <eos> THEM: Okay if you need the water for that I can go with 3 firewood for me and three waters for you but how much of a priority is food for you? <eos> YOU: It's a pretty big priority but I would be willing to negotiate on it.  <eos> THEM: Since I compromised on the water I think it would be fair for me to get 2 food rations.  <eos> YOU: Okay so I get 3 waters and 1 food, you get 3 firewoods and 2 food? <eos> THEM: Yes I'm okay with that deal. <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=1 item2=3 item0=3 item1=2 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>

How about I take one firewood, one food, and two water? <eos> YOU: Hmm, okay then. I really need water too, i have a high metabolism so i need to dink lots to stay hydrated.

Thats why I need the 3 additional firewood packages. <eos> YOU: OK. I agree to the deal <eos> THEM: Thats great, I can give you extra water and food, would that be good for you? <eos> YOU: Extra water would be fine. <eos> THEM: Great, I can give you 2 extra water and 1 extra food.

What would you say is important to you? <eos> THEM: Water is definitely the most important for me! I drink more than the average. <eos> YOU: Alirghty then! we should be able to come up with a good deal <eos> THEM: I agree! How about I take all the water, you take all the food, and we split the firewood?  <eos> YOU: Sounds perfect! It seems like the only question is how we split that firewood up. <eos> THEM: I can do 1 for me, 2 for you since you got my Star Wars opening! ;) <eos> YOU: Ha! You are a BOLD one!

So I get 3 waters and 1 food under your offer? <eos> YOU: That's right. <eos> THEM: OK.  I take that deal.

Does that sound okay to you? <eos> YOU: I really would like to have some extra water. We will be hiking and I think that we will need some extra water. <eos> THEM: Would you prefer that I take 2 waters and all three foods, and you can have all the rest? That way, we both have extra water, I can address my dehydration issues from a recent illness, and we both have what we need. <eos> YOU: If you take two waters, then it is fair that I take 2 of the food and 2 firewood. <eos> THEM: I have really bad eyesight and there are bears and mountain lions in these woods. I would need at least two firewoods or I'll probably get eaten alive. LOL  <eos> YOU: Well, I am going to be somewhere where it gets cold at night, so I will need it for the warmth. We will have small children with us. <eos> THEM: Oh, in that case, I can yield on the firewood. How about this? I take two waters, two foods, and you can have ALL of the firewood and one food and one water? <eos> YOU: How about you take 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood? <eos> THEM: Are you sure you don't want all the firewood? I can always try to find a brighter place to camp, but you have small children, so you'll need the extra wood to keep the war, comfortable, and protected from wild animals. I could take two waters, two foods, and none of the wood, so you'd have ALL the wood for yourself, as previously offered.  <eos> YOU: Okay, that is fine. I'll take 1 water, 1 food, and 3 firewood. <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </partner_input>

We're planning to camp out on the beach and will have limited access to the freshwater pipes there. But we plan to do a lot of fishing, it will be fun! What do you plan to be doing with the firewood? <eos> THEM: Sounds really fun! I will be cooking food for my family and making lots of smore's and of course singing songs around the campfire. But you can't have a campfire without firewood! <eos> YOU: That's true, smores over a butane stove doesn't quite make as fun memories as over a campfire. <eos> THEM: haha they don't thats for sure. Nothing quite like the crackling of a fire and the smell of smoke. What kind of fish are you hoping to catch? <eos> YOU: We're not 100% sure since there's all kinds of fish where we're going. My husband also wants to try crab and lobster catching too. It'll be a great way for my son to get out of the house. He's driving me crazy, with all of us cooped up due to Covid <eos> THEM: oh wow that does sound great! Ya i bet, i am also going crazy cooped up in the house with my three younger siblings <eos> YOU: So far, I've packed a lot of water, but with how active my son and husband are, I'm not sure if its enough. They plan to be doing a lot of swimming, fishing, and playing in the sand. The weather forecast is also looking like its going to be really hot. How's your planning coming along? Are you only in need of firewood? <eos> THEM: Don't want them getting dehydrated for sure! Thats a sure fire way to ruin a camping trip. My plan is coming along well thanks for asking! I need a little bit of water and a little bit of food as well. We are planning to go hiking near a mountain so during the days we  will be gone on the trails and will need to bring a bit of food and water with us <eos> YOU: That's nice! I know we're planning to cook whatever fish we catch (because its always tastier when you've grown/caught it yourself). We're planning to bring a butane stove with us but we were thinking of making a campfire for one of the days so that my son gets the experience. Idk, do you think beach driftwood would cut it? <eos> THEM: Wouldn't be quite the same for sure, there is nothing quite like an authentic campfire <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=3 item0=3 item1=1 item2=0 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

It is hot. <eos> YOU: Have you given any thought to what supplies you would need? <eos> THEM: Yes, I have. I made a list, but I definitely need to trade a few things. How about you?  <eos> YOU: I have. My biggest need is firewood because we are going to have a pretty large group and need to keep the campsite lit as much as possible <eos> THEM: I can help you with that if you can help me with food! I usually try to find food in the woods, but I'd like to take a break from that this trip. <eos> YOU: That works for me. How does this proposal sound--- I'll take 2 or 3 of the firewood (I don't know if you need any or can get by without it) You can have 2 or 3 of the food (If I only have 2 firewood I'll probably need 1 package of food) and we can split the water however. <eos> THEM: That's fair to me. I can give you all 3 of the firewood for 3 foods. I can take 2 waters, unless you need 2.  <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=0 item2=1 item0=0 item1=3 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </partner_input>

I would trade you two fire wood for 1 water <eos> THEM: That sounds fair.  If I do that, then would you be willing to let me have 2 packages of food?  <eos> YOU: I will give two packages of food  i nstead of 1 water . <eos> THEM: So how does this sound....I get 2 packages of food, 1 package of water, and 1 package of firewood?  I have five children with me on this trip so I am the most concerned about nobody getting too hungry!   <eos> YOU: No. You give me 3 packages of firewood.and I give you  2 packages of food and 1 water. <eos> THEM: I think that would work.  Do you really think you need all three packages of firewood though?  If you said you already had enough firewood then why take all three?  <eos> YOU: Yes i think it's fair. I need food and water yet I am parting with 2 packages of food and 1 water. Just trying to be fair and help you our since you have extra people with you. You can find firewood in the wild if need be. <eos> THEM: That is true, I appreciate the tip.  Hopefully it will be dry enough to use in the fire.   <eos> YOU: Is it final then? <eos> THEM: Yes that sounds good to me!

They're going to be disappointed if I am only going to get 1 firewood. What else do you need? <eos> THEM: Well, a lot of extra water would be great then since it will be hot where I'm going. If you are getting two extra firewood, I would want all the water. <eos> YOU: Then my kids won't have anything to drink. If you want 2 firewood, that's fine with me but I think it is only fair that I get 2 water and 2 food.

Would you mind if I took extra firewood? I could do without any extra food. <eos> THEM: I was looking for extra firewood as well as I have brought along 2 more people than normally planned.  So I will be cooking more at mealtime and for a longer duration.  I will not need as much water.  Could I interest you in extra water? <eos> YOU: Hmm, extra water would be good too, would still need some firewood though. I could get by with 1 firewood if I could use 3 extra water, how does that sound? <eos> THEM: The firewood deals sounds good if I am able to get 2 packages.  However not sure if I can pass on all the extra waters. <eos> YOU: Ok, so how about I get 1 firewood, 2 waters and 2 food. You would get 2 firewood, 1 food and 1 water. <eos> THEM: The problem is with the extra people I brought I'm going to have to figure out a good deal with the food as well.  I'm thinking me 3 firewood, 0 water, and 2 food.  Leaves you with 0 firewood, 3 waters and 1 food <eos> YOU: Sorry, I'd rather have more water than food. I have people I need to think about too. I think the best I can do was my previous offer. <eos> THEM: OK so let's settle each item.  Can we say we agree on I get 2 firewood and you get 1? <eos> YOU: yes, thats fine. Please remember though that my top preference was to have as much firewood as possible and you are getting more now. <eos> THEM: You also said you could get by with 1 firewood if you could get 3 waters.  Does that sound good on those two items? <eos> YOU: sure, with that, i would be good with only getting 1 extra food, you could have the other 2. <eos> THEM: Are you sure?  That's seems pretty generous of you! <eos> YOU: Well, that would be 1 firewood, 3 waters and 1 food for me. I'll gladly take 2 food if you don't need it, but I'm fine with 1. <eos> THEM: Anyway you would be willing to give up 1 of the waters? <eos> YOU: We already agreed on the wood and water, do you want 1 food or two? <eos> THEM: Ok so settled that I get 2 firewood and no water right. <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: Reject-Deal <eos> THEM: I don't think we exactly resolved the food issue.  I was telling you I had extra people with me anyway I can get 2 foods? <eos> YOU: Yes, thats fine, so that leaves me with 1 firewood, 3 water, 1 food.

I would have trouble sparing food, but I might be able to spare 1 package for a couple packages of firewood.  <eos> YOU: So you would give me 1 package of food for 2 packages of firewood? <eos> THEM: I think I could do that. If you give me the 2 packages of firewood, I might need some extra water to put out my fire the next day, though, so could I have 2 packages of water, also? <eos> YOU: So you want 2 packages of everything?  That won't leave me with enough supplies. <eos> THEM: I think that the food is quite valuable, though, that is why I am willing to give 1 package in exchange for 2 firewoods and 2 waters.

I will give you a good deal on another product if you accept.  <eos> THEM: It has rained a lot in the area I will be going to, so the availability of dry wood to scavenge for will be difficult.

Now how about your need for water? <eos> THEM: I would be willing to give you 2 and I take 1. There is plenty of rain water to collect and a spring nearby. <eos> YOU: Sorry, I am going to need a lot of water. It has been really dry here.

At the last minute my teenage son decided to bring a couple of buddy's along on the trip and I didnt pack enough food. I thought they could go fishing and catch more food but they havent been able to catch a single fish. I would also need a little extra water as well. How are you doing with your supplies. <eos> YOU: Hello, we'll we will see about that. I really need firewood most and foremost. <eos> THEM: that sounds pretty good. We did bring a propane grill for cooking so I can spare some extra firewood.  <eos> YOU: Thats awesome! Looking forward to working out a deal for you. <eos> THEM: If you will give me three food packages I will give you three firewood bundles and we just need to work out the water <eos> YOU: That sounds great to me. I would love that idea. How badly do you need water? <eos> THEM: Well I did pack some other juices and sodas so I would be willing to compromise on water <eos> YOU: Sounds great. If I could have 2, that would be great. <eos> THEM: As long as I get three food bundles and one water I guess that is acceptable.  <eos> YOU: Sounds great to me! We have a deal!  <eos> THEM: That sounds good. Thanks for working with me. <eos> YOU: Nice dealing with you!  <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=0 item2=2 item0=0 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </partner_input>
<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> THEM: What supplies would you like? <eos> YOU: Hi there, how are you? <eos> THEM: I am fine thanks.  <eos> YOU: Cool. This is going to be my kid's first camping trip so they're looking forward to building a campfire, making s'mores and telling ghost stories. I'd like to keep 3 firewood if possible. Are there supplies that you would like? <eos> THEM: I would like some firewood too as I get cold easily. You can keep all of the food for your children if you will give me at least 1 firewood and all of the water <eos> YOU: That sounds fair. So the deal will be 2 firewood and 3 food for me and 1 firewood and 3 water for you? <eos> THEM: Yes. Maybe we should negotiate more.  <eos> YOU: No worries. I completely understand. <eos> THEM: What would be your ideal preference?\ <eos> YOU: 3 firewood would have been optimal but I see your point about being cold and don't want to be that insensitive. So I am good with the 2 firewood. <eos> THEM: Okay I think that is fair.  <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=3 item2=0 item0=1 item1=0 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>
<input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </input> <dialogue> THEM: What are your preferences on extra supplies you preffer? <eos> YOU: Hi! I would prefer to take all of the food.  You can have all the firewood.  As far as water, would you be ok with me taking all that too? I have a huge family.  Brought my elderly grandmother also  <eos> THEM: Would you be ok with taking 2 packs of food instead of all 3? <eos> YOU: I prefer all 3, would you be willing to take a water instead? <eos> THEM: since I'm camping alone and you have a family if I can give you 2 fire wood, 2 food and 2 water and I have 1 extra supply of each. Would that work for you and the family? <eos> YOU: That actually will work for me as long as you are ok with it <eos> THEM: I feel since your with a family it would be ok with me.  <eos> YOU: Thank you! I appreciate the generosity  <eos> THEM: will your family be ok with that deal? <eos> YOU: Yes! We will.  We will enjoy our camping trip with these extra supplies <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=2 item2=2 item0=1 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>

Do you have enough of everything you need for your trip? <eos> THEM: no bro, lets talk about the deal, bro dont end the negotiation it will lost both of us  <eos> YOU: I understand. So what do you need the most? I really, really need firewood. I'm already almost out, and it's supposed to get very cold  <eos> THEM: bro my first priority also firewood, what is ur second priority bro, me too need firewood  <eos> YOU: My second priority is water. <eos> THEM: then how can we fix the deal bro me too need firewood  <eos> YOU: How about I'll take 2 firewoods, but give you 2 waters? <eos> THEM: bropls give me 2 firewood u can take 2 water bro, i need fire wood more bro <eos> YOU: I can't. I've got to have firewood. How about if you give me the 2 firewoods, I will only take 1 of everything else? <eos> THEM: bro if you take 2 fire wood then  i need 1 firewood 3 water 2 food bro, then only it will balanced <eos> YOU: That would leave me with no water? That doesn't seem very balanced.  <eos> THEM: bro firewood is first priority mean you got firewood more then it is more benificial to you  <eos> YOU: Yea, but that's why I only want 1 of everything else. That leaves you 2 of everything except the firewood. That sounds pretty fair to me. <eos> THEM: if you need all, then make firewood 1 to you then it will balance, if u take one water from me its not equalize, <eos> YOU: You would be getting 5 items, and I'm only getting 4. That's pretty balanced.  <eos> THEM: then can we go for wiseversa? i will take 2 firewood, 1 water, 1 food is it ok? then will get 6 items  <eos> YOU: I'll do the vise-versa.  <eos> THEM: then tell me you deal vise wersa means? send me your deal <eos> YOU: You get 2 firewood, I get 1. I get 2 waters, and 2 foods, and you get 1 of each? <eos> THEM: k bro we can fix the deal 2 firewood, i water , 1 food <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: Reject-Deal <eos>  </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>
