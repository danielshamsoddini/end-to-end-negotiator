<input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello <eos> YOU: hi ! i'm going camping soon with my family at a lake ! we're looking forward to it so much since we haven't been able to get out due to covid . are you going camping too ? <eos> THEM: yes ! i am also going with my family . my husband and i are essential workers but his hours all got cut . i got laid off from my job for part of the time . <eos> YOU: oh man that sucks ! i know congress is currently debating all of the unemployment stuff too . where do you plan to be going camping ? <eos> THEM: we didn't get unemployment or a stimulus check . we are planning a trip to missouri , lake of the ozarks . our younger children have been cooped up so long we are hoping to let them get some sun and swimming in ! <eos> YOU: that sounds nice , maybe everyone just needs some fun to stay positive about everything . we're going camping along a lake and plan to do a lot of fishing . my husband got these filtration thingies so that we can drink the lake water but i don't really trust them . this will be my kid's first ever camping trip so we're super excited to make it fun for him . <eos> THEM: we have 7 people in our family , . . the youngest two kids have hardly been anywhere because of working . i think our camping area has those old fashioned hand pumps . <eos> YOU: your two youngest kids are working ? how old is everyone ? if there's a lot of people , it will be easier to split up the duties and get things done . my son's 3 years old so as much as he's eager to help , there's not much he can do lol . <eos> THEM: ha ha . . . no my too youngest have hardly been anywhere because of us adults working , i have teens ( 17 , 15 ) , tweens ( 13 ) and littles ( 10 , 7 ) . we 3 boys and 3 girls . we have a 21 year old but he's in a band so h can't go . they all pitch in anytime . they eat a lot so they have to cook from scratch at home . awww 3 is so adorable . . . that's when they are sure they can do and will work so hard ! <eos> YOU: home cooking's the best , yumyums ! we're planning on doing a lot of fishing since my son's been in love with fishing toys and is currently in love with eating fish ( he hasn't gotten tired of eating it every night for dinner ) . we're thinking of cooking what we catch every night . do you have any activities planned for your camping trip ? <eos> THEM: fishing is so fun ! we really don't have a plan . . . so many people , so many opinions . if you'll be fishing and eating your catch , you'll probably need more firewood than food . and with the filters , you will need some extra water , especially for your little guy . so would you agree that you take 2 firewood packages , 1 food package and 1 extra water . <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: reject - deal <eos> YOU: reject - deal <eos> THEM: reject - deal <eos> YOU: reject - deal <eos> THEM: reject - deal <eos> YOU: reject - deal <eos> THEM: reject - deal <eos> YOU: reject - deal <eos> THEM: reject - deal <eos> YOU: reject - deal <eos> THEM: reject - deal <eos> YOU: reject - deal <eos>  </dialogue> <output> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> <no_agreement> </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>
