<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello ! how are you today ? food is usually a pretty valuable resource , but i'm willing to let you have all of the food if i can have the wood and water . <eos> THEM: hi there , i'm doing ok . i accidentally spilled my water on my firewood . i'm in a world of hurt right now . <eos> YOU: whoops ! that's never good . at least the wood can dry out a bit ! with as hot as it is lately , it should be dry in no time . <eos> THEM: good point , but its really humid where i am . how about we split each category . . you can have 2 of the food , 1 water and 1 firewood , leaving me with 2 firewood , 2 water and just 1 food . <eos> YOU: i have plenty of food , plus we brought our hunting equipment . i do agree that we should find a good way to split it , but since the site i'm camping at does not have a clean water source , i really need the water . how about i take two water and two firewood , then you can have all the food , one water , and one firewood ? <eos> THEM: that really won't help me as i have plenty of food and no water or dry firewood . how about i take 3 of the hardwood and just 1 water and you can have all of the food and 2 of water ? <eos> YOU: i think we can reach an agreement on this : - ) we both need water and firewood , and we both have plenty of food . i do not want you to go without , but i really don't want to cut myself short on supplies either . i think i can make do with just two waters . i'm hesitant about the firewood , though . is there anywhere nearby that you might can collect some wood so i can possibly have one ? <eos> THEM: i'm not sure , but i will agree to giving you 1 firewood , 2 waters and 2 of the food . this way , we are splitting all of it , leaving me with 2 firewood , 1 water and 1 food . <eos> YOU: i think i can live with that deal . i accept your offer ! <eos> THEM: thank you for the wonderful chat and i hope you have a fun time camping ! <eos> YOU: i hope you have a great time on your trip as well ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: i would really like to have 3 waters and 3 firewood because this is my first time camping and i don't have survival skills . <eos> THEM: you must be a comedian . we will need to come to a compromise because there's no way that's going to happen . i am like a water buffalo so i'll need at least two waters . in addition , my family is from the south and will need firewood as well . <eos> YOU: i can't swim too . i think two waters will help me to survive on this trip and i will need at least two firewood to make fish or other food items for my family . <eos> THEM: you don't need this water to swim . you can take two of the food if you're worried about food . i will take two water and two firewood since i have a large family to nourish and keep warm . your initial suggestion of 3 waters and firewood is laughable . please provide a realistic compromise . <eos> YOU: if i take two waters , 1 firewood , and 2 food supplies , this will help me during the trip . it seems as if you are more skilled than i am on a camping trip . please consider my request <eos> THEM: lol - not a chance . you're going to have to give me more than that . i am more skilled and thus need firewood . how about this . . . i will take 3 firewood and 2 food . you can take all the water because you're so non - skilled in the wilderness . i am going to hunt for my food , but again i have a large family . i am not considering your request at all . we will need to come to a decision relatively soon . <eos> YOU: i understand your preferences . if i take all of the water , 1 firewood , and 2 food your family will still have the opportunity to have a good camping trip and i can learn to survive on this trip . please consider my request again . <eos> THEM: ok - you're not being reasonable at all . if you're so incompetent at going camping , maybe you should stay home and i can take all the supplies . how's that for an excellent offer ? all for me and 0 for you . <eos> YOU: i think it would be good to come to a compromise . if i take all of the water and have the 2 foods , you can take all of the firewood as you originally proposed . yet , i will have a tough time learning how to survive on a camping trip . <eos> THEM: again , that's not a fair compromise . . . . you get all of what we both we want and more of another item . let me state it to you clearly so you can understand . i will not accept that offer . there is no chance you are getting all the water now that i think about it . i will offer i get 1 water , 2 firewood , and 2 food . if you can't come up with a reasonable offer , i will just walk away and we both get nothing . i will survive because i will have skills . <eos> YOU: i think this is reasonable because you have a big family . i will accept 2 waters , 1 firewood , and 1 food . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello ! i'm looking forward to making a deal . let's find something that works for us both . <eos> YOU: hello there . i am absolutely interested in coming to an agreement as well . it's pleasant to meet you ! <eos> THEM: nice to meet you too . so what do you need most ? <eos> YOU: so , i'm a chef . my largest concern is getting a nice , hot , fire . in order to do that i'll need firewood the most . what are you looking for the most ? <eos> THEM: that's awesome ! i am most definitely not a chef , but i'm going to be doing a lot of hiking , so i'll need a lot of water to stay hydrated . and a bit of extra food to keep us all full . <eos> YOU: fair enough . i'm also going to need a bit of water , but i'm sure we can come to an agreement fair for both of us . as far as food goes , i only require very little , my pantry already is pretty stocked there . <eos> THEM: well , if i take 2 waters and you take 1 , will you let me have all of the food ? <eos> YOU: i think that's asking a bit too much , because i still would like some food . i'd be willing to take all the firewood , one water , and one food , if that sounds passable to you . <eos> THEM: well , if i'm splitting the food and water with you , i'd like a single firewood . i'm no chef , but it'll be freezing cold overnight , and i just need a little extra to keep warm . <eos> YOU: i must insist on the firewood , that's the most important thing to me - you should have enough from your default package for a nice fire . i could use more water , but i'm letting you take the lions share of that , so i think one food isn't too unfair for that . <eos> THEM: okay , that's fair . you put in the deal , and i'll gladly accept . <eos> YOU: alrighty . hope you have fun on your hiking ! make sure you stay hydrated . going to push it through now . <eos> THEM: sounds good , you have fun , too ! and good luck cooking up all that food , chef ! <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>
<input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: so i was thinking i'd take 2 waters and only 1 of the firewood and food . <eos> YOU: would you be open to doing that the other way around ? <eos> THEM: i don't know . i really don't think i have enough water to cover all the hiking . i could definitely use extra . <eos> YOU: yeah , i'm in the same boat , i'm one of those types that is overly cautious and like having as much water as possible , just in case . <eos> THEM: hm . well what about firewood ? how are you with that ? <eos> YOU: i could do with or without a fire , it's not a top priority like food and water <eos> THEM: well i have trouble with starting fires , so the extra firewood would be beneficial to me . . . i know i'll need a fire going each night . so what if i took all 3 firewood and then you could have the majority of the water ? <eos> YOU: so you would get 1 water , 1 food and 3 firewood ? <eos> THEM: i would be interested in negotiating for a little more food in that case , but yes , otherwise that is what i am proposing . <eos> YOU: well , that would put you at 6 items and me at 3 <eos> THEM: well you didn't really need the firewood right ? i , on the other hand , could use all of it . if i'm willing to take only 1 food package , are you good with the deal ? <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello . i hope you are well . i would like to have all of the water , 2 of the firewood and 1 of the food . <eos> THEM: hello . i'm actually not doing too well . there have been a few problems and i will need some of the extra packages . i'll need two of the waters , 2 of the firewood and 2 of the food . <eos> YOU: i'm sorry to hear that you are not doing well . i've also have some issues . on the way up to the camp site , all of my clean water spilled in the car . i was really hoping to be able to get all of the available water . why aren't you well ? i hope it's not serious . <eos> THEM: oh , that's terrible . i'm sorry that happened . i need the water for my child . they seem dehydrated and disoriented . my husband has also caught a cold and has been having chills . i thought the extra firewood would help him feel better . <eos> YOU: oh my gosh . you are not having an easy trip . if your children are dehydrated and disoriented , perhaps you should get them to emergency care immediately . i would like to provide you will all of the water in the meantime , but that would leave me with none at all . i wouldn't have your husband out of the tent with chills . perhaps you should keep him bundled in your cabin . i forgot my portable propane grill - so i would need some firewood . how about i take 2 waters , 1 firewood and all of the food ? <eos> THEM: oh dear , you spilled your water and forgot your grill ? you mentioned that you had a car . perhaps you could take a quick drive to grab some extra water . for now , i definitely agree that you need 1 extra water and 1 firewood . i will need 2 of the extra food portions though . how does that sound ? <eos> YOU: wish it was an easy car ride . we're miles and miles from a store and it's getting dark . i don't do well driving in the dark . i think we might be getting close to agreement . as i understand it: you would get 1 water , 2 firewood and 2 food portions ? is that correct ? <eos> THEM: actually , i suggested that you would get 1 water , 1 firewood and 1 food portion . i can compromise with you though . i would like 2 water portions , 1 firewood and 1 food . <eos> YOU: since i arrived with no water at all , i would definitely need at least 2 waters . i'm afraid i don't have a lot of " wiggle room " with that . i'm open for the other supplies . ideally , i would like to have 2 waters , 1 firewood and 1 food portion . <eos> THEM: if that's the case , i would like 1 water , 3 firewood and 3 food portions . <eos> YOU: would you be open to me having 2 waters , and 1 food portion ? while trying to get together some wood to start a fire , i came across a stray pup . he seems very friendly - so i'm thinking he must have gotten separated from his family . he's very hungry though - an extra food portion would be a great help . <eos> THEM: deal <eos> YOU: wonderful ! i'll submit our deal now . it was nice working with you . all the best to you and your family - take care of them ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=1 item2=2 item0=3 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello ! i'd really like 3 water and 3 firewood . you could have all of the food , as i would rather not have a ton of it due to the risk of wild animals poking around my campsite . <eos> YOU: i couldn't possibly give you all of the water . i have a baby , and i need to make formula for her . what if i take 2 of the water ? <eos> THEM: i'm afraid 2 of the water is too much . it's very hard to find potable water in the wilderness , so i need as much as i can get . i would be willing to part with a maximum of 1 water . <eos> YOU: unfortunately , i have the same issue of needing the water . i don't mind giving you all of the firewood , but parting with 2 waters would be very difficult . <eos> THEM: i'll let you have 2 waters if i can take all the firewood and food ? <eos> YOU: i can't give you all of the food . what if you take all of the firewood , one water and one food ? <eos> THEM: if you're going to take the most of the water , which is the most important item for me , i feel it's only fair to have all of firewood , one water , and two food . <eos> YOU: you'd be taking 6 items and only leaving me 3 . that doesn't seem fair . <eos> THEM: the two waters alone are worth the most . but i'll concede - - i'll take the firewood , one water , and one food . <eos> YOU: that would work for me as well . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello there . <eos> YOU: hello , how are you ? hoping today is finding you well . i am taking 40 kids camping . i was wondering if its okay if i can get all 3 foods , i am willing to trade all waters for it . i really need the extra supplies , since the needs of children differ than adults . in case , the food is not properly stored or if the kids eat more <eos> THEM: interesting . well i do need some food , as i plan to go hiking . for that i will need energy . <eos> YOU: yes , its our annual youth camp . i completely understand needed an extra food . are you in need of firewood ? maybe we can work something out with firewood and water for all 3 foods . my kiddos are little rascals and east everything on sight . <eos> THEM: if i have to shorten my hiking per day without extra food , i will need some heavy compensation because now it will take longer for me to reach my destination without energy . water alone will be hard . <eos> YOU: i completely understand , what do you have in mind ? will you be hiking alone or do you have people coming along ? <eos> THEM: i will be hiking alone on this trip . i would consider giving you all the food . i would need all the water and firewood in return . the firewood would be helpful to keep animals away while i rest . <eos> YOU: i completely understand as i too was thinking of using firewood not to only keep wild life away , but the bugs . will you be okay if i get one fire wood ? i have alot of cooking to do . not sure if it will be raining when we go camping , and if it is raining , i am unsure if i will be able to use the tree branches and brush . . since they will be wet . what do you think ? <eos> THEM: i suppose i can give you one firewood . <eos> YOU: thank you so much . you are very kind , the kiddos will be happy to hear about the extra supplies . to recap i will be getting 3 waters 1 fire wood and 0 waters . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=0 item0=2 item1=0 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </input> <dialogue> THEM: how's it going ? if it's alright with you , you can have all of the water and i'll take all of the firewood . we can work out a deal on the food as well . <eos> YOU: i have circulatory issued due to a heart condition and cold quickly . i would appreciate if i could get at least 2 of the firewood . you can have 2 of the food so you won't get hungry . <eos> THEM: i was planning on building a big bonfire for the evening . there'd be plenty of room if you wanted to join for warmth . i'm a bit hungry and would appreciate the extra food . you can have all of the water if you'd like . if you warm it by the bonfire , it may be useful to soak in to improve your circulation . <eos> YOU: i get tired to easy so i probably won't be much fun at a bonfire . i really do appreciate the offer though . i would think the extra food would do you more good for your party . <eos> THEM: the extra food would be appreciated . how about if i take just two each of the firewood and food , and you can have the remainder , plus all of the water ? <eos> YOU: i am just concerned that only 1 firewood might make it so i'm too cold to function . <eos> THEM: if you boil the water above the fire , it will provide additional heat over time . you would also be able to make tea , which would warm you up from the inside as well , better than any fire would . that would probably be most beneficial to you . i really do need the 2 firewood if there's any chance of making a bonfire for my party . <eos> YOU: i am allergic to tea and coffee . i wonder if the smaller fire would be more quaint for everyone to sit around . <eos> THEM: it really wouldn't do the job that well at all . you could always prepare hot cocoa or use your share of the food to make a warm stew . i really do need at least the two firewood and a couple of food . you can have all the water to make a hearty and hot stew to get your through the night , though . <eos> YOU: i can't eat much anyway because of the health issues . you could have all of the food if i could get the extra firewood . that would still give you an extra firewood in addition to the basic supply and lots of extra food for your party . i'm sure they would love having some of the stew you mentioned . <eos> THEM: well , how about i take just the one extra firewood , plus all of the food , and one of the water so that i can make stew ? would that work for you ? <eos> YOU: that sounds good . i hope your party is wonderful . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello ! how are you today ? food is usually a pretty valuable resource , but i'm willing to let you have all of the food if i can have the wood and water . <eos> THEM: hi there , i'm doing ok . i accidentally spilled my water on my firewood . i'm in a world of hurt right now . <eos> YOU: whoops ! that's never good . at least the wood can dry out a bit ! with as hot as it is lately , it should be dry in no time . <eos> THEM: good point , but its really humid where i am . how about we split each category . . you can have 2 of the food , 1 water and 1 firewood , leaving me with 2 firewood , 2 water and just 1 food . <eos> YOU: i have plenty of food , plus we brought our hunting equipment . i do agree that we should find a good way to split it , but since the site i'm camping at does not have a clean water source , i really need the water . how about i take two water and two firewood , then you can have all the food , one water , and one firewood ? <eos> THEM: that really won't help me as i have plenty of food and no water or dry firewood . how about i take 3 of the hardwood and just 1 water and you can have all of the food and 2 of water ? <eos> YOU: i think we can reach an agreement on this : - ) we both need water and firewood , and we both have plenty of food . i do not want you to go without , but i really don't want to cut myself short on supplies either . i think i can make do with just two waters . i'm hesitant about the firewood , though . is there anywhere nearby that you might can collect some wood so i can possibly have one ? <eos> THEM: i'm not sure , but i will agree to giving you 1 firewood , 2 waters and 2 of the food . this way , we are splitting all of it , leaving me with 2 firewood , 1 water and 1 food . <eos> YOU: i think i can live with that deal . i accept your offer ! <eos> THEM: thank you for the wonderful chat and i hope you have a fun time camping ! <eos> YOU: i hope you have a great time on your trip as well ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: i would really like to have 3 waters and 3 firewood because this is my first time camping and i don't have survival skills . <eos> THEM: you must be a comedian . we will need to come to a compromise because there's no way that's going to happen . i am like a water buffalo so i'll need at least two waters . in addition , my family is from the south and will need firewood as well . <eos> YOU: i can't swim too . i think two waters will help me to survive on this trip and i will need at least two firewood to make fish or other food items for my family . <eos> THEM: you don't need this water to swim . you can take two of the food if you're worried about food . i will take two water and two firewood since i have a large family to nourish and keep warm . your initial suggestion of 3 waters and firewood is laughable . please provide a realistic compromise . <eos> YOU: if i take two waters , 1 firewood , and 2 food supplies , this will help me during the trip . it seems as if you are more skilled than i am on a camping trip . please consider my request <eos> THEM: lol - not a chance . you're going to have to give me more than that . i am more skilled and thus need firewood . how about this . . . i will take 3 firewood and 2 food . you can take all the water because you're so non - skilled in the wilderness . i am going to hunt for my food , but again i have a large family . i am not considering your request at all . we will need to come to a decision relatively soon . <eos> YOU: i understand your preferences . if i take all of the water , 1 firewood , and 2 food your family will still have the opportunity to have a good camping trip and i can learn to survive on this trip . please consider my request again . <eos> THEM: ok - you're not being reasonable at all . if you're so incompetent at going camping , maybe you should stay home and i can take all the supplies . how's that for an excellent offer ? all for me and 0 for you . <eos> YOU: i think it would be good to come to a compromise . if i take all of the water and have the 2 foods , you can take all of the firewood as you originally proposed . yet , i will have a tough time learning how to survive on a camping trip . <eos> THEM: again , that's not a fair compromise . . . . you get all of what we both we want and more of another item . let me state it to you clearly so you can understand . i will not accept that offer . there is no chance you are getting all the water now that i think about it . i will offer i get 1 water , 2 firewood , and 2 food . if you can't come up with a reasonable offer , i will just walk away and we both get nothing . i will survive because i will have skills . <eos> YOU: i think this is reasonable because you have a big family . i will accept 2 waters , 1 firewood , and 1 food . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: what are your preferences for additional supplies ? <eos> THEM: i could use water the most , you ? <eos> YOU: i need more food . <eos> THEM: sure , i can make that work , how are you doing in regards to firewood ? <eos> YOU: i need some firewood too . <eos> THEM: ah , then we are both in the same boat in regards to that . <eos> YOU: we can split firewood . but i need most food because i have diabetics , i need sufficient food supply to stay healthy . <eos> THEM: sure , i'm willing to let you have all the food , if you let me have all the water . <eos> YOU: sounds good . i'll take 3 packages of food , and you can have all 3 packages of water . <eos> THEM: sure , and as for the wood , since there is only three i figure we should do a 2 - 1 split , although if you don't mind i'd prefer the 2 - heard the camp area i'm headed to got cleared of most of its dead wood so there won't be much to find for a fire . <eos> YOU: i'm wondering if i can get 2 packages of firewood . the local weather forecast says there's a 50 % chance of rain , i'd need as much wood as possible to stay dry if it does rain . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=3 item2=0 item0=1 item1=0 item2=3 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello ! i'm looking forward to making a deal . let's find something that works for us both . <eos> YOU: hello there . i am absolutely interested in coming to an agreement as well . it's pleasant to meet you ! <eos> THEM: nice to meet you too . so what do you need most ? <eos> YOU: so , i'm a chef . my largest concern is getting a nice , hot , fire . in order to do that i'll need firewood the most . what are you looking for the most ? <eos> THEM: that's awesome ! i am most definitely not a chef , but i'm going to be doing a lot of hiking , so i'll need a lot of water to stay hydrated . and a bit of extra food to keep us all full . <eos> YOU: fair enough . i'm also going to need a bit of water , but i'm sure we can come to an agreement fair for both of us . as far as food goes , i only require very little , my pantry already is pretty stocked there . <eos> THEM: well , if i take 2 waters and you take 1 , will you let me have all of the food ? <eos> YOU: i think that's asking a bit too much , because i still would like some food . i'd be willing to take all the firewood , one water , and one food , if that sounds passable to you . <eos> THEM: well , if i'm splitting the food and water with you , i'd like a single firewood . i'm no chef , but it'll be freezing cold overnight , and i just need a little extra to keep warm . <eos> YOU: i must insist on the firewood , that's the most important thing to me - you should have enough from your default package for a nice fire . i could use more water , but i'm letting you take the lions share of that , so i think one food isn't too unfair for that . <eos> THEM: okay , that's fair . you put in the deal , and i'll gladly accept . <eos> YOU: alrighty . hope you have fun on your hiking ! make sure you stay hydrated . going to push it through now . <eos> THEM: sounds good , you have fun , too ! and good luck cooking up all that food , chef ! <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </partner_input>

<input> 3 1 3 2 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello ! i'd really like 3 water and 3 firewood . you could have all of the food , as i would rather not have a ton of it due to the risk of wild animals poking around my campsite . <eos> YOU: i couldn't possibly give you all of the water . i have a baby , and i need to make formula for her . what if i take 2 of the water ? <eos> THEM: i'm afraid 2 of the water is too much . it's very hard to find potable water in the wilderness , so i need as much as i can get . i would be willing to part with a maximum of 1 water . <eos> YOU: unfortunately , i have the same issue of needing the water . i don't mind giving you all of the firewood , but parting with 2 waters would be very difficult . <eos> THEM: i'll let you have 2 waters if i can take all the firewood and food ? <eos> YOU: i can't give you all of the food . what if you take all of the firewood , one water and one food ? <eos> THEM: if you're going to take the most of the water , which is the most important item for me , i feel it's only fair to have all of firewood , one water , and two food . <eos> YOU: you'd be taking 6 items and only leaving me 3 . that doesn't seem fair . <eos> THEM: the two waters alone are worth the most . but i'll concede - - i'll take the firewood , one water , and one food . <eos> YOU: that would work for me as well . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 1 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello ! <eos> THEM: hello ! yay , we get to camp ! <eos> YOU: heck yes ! i am excited . how about you ? <eos> THEM: i can't wait let's talk about these supplies . i've got hungry mouths to feed , can i take the food and you can have half the firewood and all the water ? <eos> YOU: hmm , i need food too . i am willing to split . i will give you 2 food since you claimed it first . can i have 2 waters then ? <eos> THEM: that's fair , but i have wiggle room on the water , how about i take two food , two firewood and you take 3 water , 1 food , 1 firewood ? <eos> YOU: is there anyway you will go with that i get two firewood ? i need food the most but since you get most of that can i get most of the firewood ? so 1 food , 2 firewood , and 2 water for me ? <eos> THEM: you drive a hard bargain . i could really use that firewood . it's going to get cold tonight and these sleeping bags are not worth the price i paid ; ) <eos> YOU: haha , i know but i am in the same situation ! and since i am getting less food i feel like it is fair i get on more firewood since i truly need that <eos> THEM: some extra water for coffee might keep us warm , would you consider taking 1 food , 2 wood , 1 water ? <eos> YOU: sure i can do that <eos> THEM: i think we have a deal ! ! <eos> YOU: awesome ! enjoy your trip ! and stay warm ; ) <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>
<input> 3 3 3 1 3 2 </input> <dialogue> THEM: how's it going ? if it's alright with you , you can have all of the water and i'll take all of the firewood . we can work out a deal on the food as well . <eos> YOU: i have circulatory issued due to a heart condition and cold quickly . i would appreciate if i could get at least 2 of the firewood . you can have 2 of the food so you won't get hungry . <eos> THEM: i was planning on building a big bonfire for the evening . there'd be plenty of room if you wanted to join for warmth . i'm a bit hungry and would appreciate the extra food . you can have all of the water if you'd like . if you warm it by the bonfire , it may be useful to soak in to improve your circulation . <eos> YOU: i get tired to easy so i probably won't be much fun at a bonfire . i really do appreciate the offer though . i would think the extra food would do you more good for your party . <eos> THEM: the extra food would be appreciated . how about if i take just two each of the firewood and food , and you can have the remainder , plus all of the water ? <eos> YOU: i am just concerned that only 1 firewood might make it so i'm too cold to function . <eos> THEM: if you boil the water above the fire , it will provide additional heat over time . you would also be able to make tea , which would warm you up from the inside as well , better than any fire would . that would probably be most beneficial to you . i really do need the 2 firewood if there's any chance of making a bonfire for my party . <eos> YOU: i am allergic to tea and coffee . i wonder if the smaller fire would be more quaint for everyone to sit around . <eos> THEM: it really wouldn't do the job that well at all . you could always prepare hot cocoa or use your share of the food to make a warm stew . i really do need at least the two firewood and a couple of food . you can have all the water to make a hearty and hot stew to get your through the night , though . <eos> YOU: i can't eat much anyway because of the health issues . you could have all of the food if i could get the extra firewood . that would still give you an extra firewood in addition to the basic supply and lots of extra food for your party . i'm sure they would love having some of the stew you mentioned . <eos> THEM: well , how about i take just the one extra firewood , plus all of the food , and one of the water so that i can make stew ? would that work for you ? <eos> YOU: that sounds good . i hope your party is wonderful . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </partner_input>
<input> 3 1 3 3 3 2 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello i would like to get some food and firewood if that's ok with you . i hope to make my family a delicious meal . <eos> YOU: sure no problem ; how much firewood do you need ? <eos> THEM: food is more of a priority but two of them and one water would be good i think <eos> YOU: i understand you completely . what exactly were you planning to make with these items ? <eos> THEM: i will be making some flame grilled steak . <eos> YOU: that sounds very yummy . is there a particular reason you want to make that dish ? <eos> THEM: no i just think of myself as a chef so i like to make cool dishes . <eos> YOU: oh that's nice . how badly would you need these items ? <eos> THEM: what's with the angry face ? i need my two food and firewood items very badly . <eos> YOU: does my face look angry ? nah , it is just your impression . anyways , do you think that if i gave you the items that you would cook a good meal ? <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>
<input> 3 3 3 2 3 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , i would like negotiate with you for some supplies for a camping trip <eos> THEM: what do you have in mind , i could use some things myself <eos> YOU: we have most basic necessities but could use some more firewood , food and water . <eos> THEM: we have some of that , but would like to know which you need the most ? <eos> YOU: we are taking our small child camping with us for the first time , and are thinking we would need the most firewood to help keep them warm . <eos> THEM: i would be willing to give up a little firewood and some water if you can give me as much food as possible . i vastly underestimated how much food i would need <eos> YOU: i do believe that would be possible . <eos> THEM: thanks , is there a preference on how much firewood you need ? <eos> YOU: 3 packages would be ideal , but i can certainly work with what you are willing to share . is there a certain amount of food you need ? <eos> THEM: same situation as you , please make a trade offer and i will accept if it is fair to both parties <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=0 item2=2 item0=0 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 2 3 3 3 1 </partner_input>
