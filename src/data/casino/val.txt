<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hi i was wondering if i could maybe get 2 of the water since i left half of mine at home and you could take 1 water if you need ? does this sound ok ? <eos> THEM: i'm sorry . i brought my dogs so i would need 2 bottles for me . you could have 1 . i would give you all my firewood since i would not use it . <eos> YOU: okay that sounds wonderful i broke my leg and am only camping with kids so they cant help me gather firewood so it is ok if i take all three firewood ? so kind of you ! <eos> THEM: yes of course , you can have all of it . <eos> YOU: ok , so what do we think about the food ? do you need any food at all ? what are your thoughts ? lets come to a good compromise ! <eos> THEM: sounds great , i would want all the food . would hope that you can manage with some food of your own , i guess this would not be a difficult task . i cannot cook so any pre - packaged food would be good for me and my dogs . <eos> YOU: what kind of dogs do you have ? do they eat a lot ? i know small dogs tend to eat less so maybe all the packages could be too much for u guys <eos> THEM: i do have a poodle and a yorkie and maltese mix . the poodle is standard size , that baby eats a bit ! i guess i would also need extra food since i would be cutting my own firewood and that would mean i would need to hike a bit . <eos> YOU: the dog i grew up with was a toy poodle ! ! they are such cute and smart pups ! ! ! ! i wish i had a standard poodle now . i have a boxer and hes a silly nut ! i understand why you need extra . i was just trying to at least get two for my trip for the kiddos . we had some kids join last minute and i definitely dont have enough to feed them all . <eos> THEM: sorry to hear , however too many can jeopardize the trip . it can also be dangerous to bring so many kids since any of them could get sick or worst scenario that would get into some kind of trouble . if i were you i would not bring such large group . i definitely need all the food given since it has been a while that i do not camp or have a vacation so that is why i would love to bring my dogs along . <eos> YOU: well i didnt have a choice to bring them but here we are lol . but could you at least give me one package of food ? <eos> THEM: i am sorry , i could give you an extra water and i keep 1 . i do need the food and you do have a choice , you can just be honest to them and let them know you don't have enough food . i believe that too many people can definitely jeopardize . <eos> YOU: okay that sounds like a deal . ill take all the fire ill take 2 water and you have all the food sound good ? <eos> THEM: sounds great , good deal ! i'm sure we will have a lot of adventure in this trip . <eos> YOU: thanks hun hope those little dogs dont dehydrate and overheat . it would be a shame . have fun ! <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=0 item2=2 item0=0 item1=3 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello ! i would like make a deal with you on firewood , water and food ! are you interested in any items ? <eos> YOU: yes , i'd definitely be interested . how are you doing ? <eos> THEM: not bad , not bad . how are you . what's on your mind for camping ? <eos> YOU: i'm doing well . we're desperately needing wood . we didn't realize how cold it would be as it is our first time here . there is none around our area so we are really concerned about staying warm especially at night . we also forgot a bag of food , so that's another need for us . <eos> THEM: true . turns out i'm dealing with similar situation , we didn't expect weather to be as cold , so extra wood is on my mind as well . everyone might need to go to bed earlier and cook food that cooks short time since we low on wood ! <eos> YOU: yes , that's very true . i would be willing to give up water for more firewood . <eos> THEM: i like that . i could help you out . i'd be interested in giving you some extra food for extra water . we like to go far from campsite to hike and get up to high elevation , so i need to pack extra water just in case . we go during day , when it's warmest and need extra food in case we come back at nigh time or get lost ! not ideal . <eos> YOU: you can never be too prepared . we stay closer to camp as we have little ones with us on this trip . <eos> THEM: are you interested in taking 1 firewood , all 3 foods and 1 water ? and then what's left would be to us ? <eos> YOU: i would do 2 firewood , 3 foods and 0 water . <eos> THEM: well it's important for both of us to get that wood ! <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: reject - deal <eos> THEM: in order to get all food , can you give me additional firewood ? <eos> YOU: how about i do: 2 firewood , 2 food and 1 water ? <eos> THEM: well , what would it take for you to give up extra wood ? <eos> YOU: 3 food and 2 water <eos> THEM: ok let's go with that . you take 3 food , 2 water and 1 firewood , let's make it happen that way and move on with camping ! <eos>  </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=2 item0=2 item1=0 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello i would like at least 2 of the waters because i will be camping in a very hot area and be doing some hiking . 2 foods because i have a couple friends that can not afford their own . also 1 firewood so that i can cook the food . <eos> THEM: i think we can come to an agreement on the food and firewood , however i would like 2 waters for the same reason . <eos> YOU: i will give you 2 waters if i can have 3 firewood . <eos> THEM: i'll only give you 3 firewood if i get 3 waters and 1 food . <eos> YOU: well i surely do need some water more than i need 3 firewood . <eos> THEM: keep in mind , this for extra supplies . we get a basic set by default . how about i take 2 waters , 1 firewood , and 1 food . that gives you 1 water , 2 firewood , and 2 food . <eos> YOU: i do know it is for extra supplies . another reason i am asking for the 3 firewood is there will not be extra wood to cut around my campsite . <eos> THEM: what do you feel is your highest priority item here ? i consider water to be most important to me . <eos> YOU: water is by far for me . considering the 100 degree weather and hiking i will be doing . <eos> THEM: in that case , i'll give you 2 waters but then i want 2 firewood and 2 food . <eos> YOU: how about i have 2 water , 1 food , and 2 firewood . <eos> THEM: no , i've already given you the better deal . take 2 water , 1 food , and 1 firewood or i will walk away . <eos> YOU: i believe the deal i just gave you is more fair for both of us . also walking away is not a good idea . <eos> THEM: if we assign a point value of 3 , 2 , and 1 . you are getting 6 , 2 , and 1 ( 9 points ) . i am getting 3 , 4 , and 2 ( 9 points ) . my deal is a fair deal . your deal leaves me with 7 points . so i say again , you can have 2 water , 1 food , and 1 firewood . that is equal point value . <eos> YOU: alright i accept . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=2 item0=2 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>
