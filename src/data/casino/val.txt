<input> 3 3 3 9 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: dear friend . i am going camping and am in need of provisions . i am weary , but we must come to an agreement . i am requesting 3 food , 2 water , and 2 firewood . i know this is a big request , but the need is great . would you be so kind as to accept this request ? <eos> THEM: hi , i'm afraid i am also in dire need of them as well . i am open to negotiating , but will need a much fairer split than 3 , 2 , 2 . i propose 2 food for myself , 3 firewood , and 1 water <eos> YOU: you say fair , but that strikes me as a rather uneven split . what is your # 1 need ? <eos> THEM: i need food the most , and you ? <eos> YOU: i too need food most . if you have 2 food , that would leave me with only one of my most needed resource . i could possibly make this work , but then i would need 3 water and 2 firewood . <eos> THEM: i think the fairest would be a 5 / 4 split as there are 9 resources . why don't you take 2 food and 2 water . i will take 1 food , 3 firewood , and 1 water ? <eos> YOU: yes , agree to the first point . what is your second most needed resource ? <eos> THEM: firewood . i assume yours is water . thus if you get 2 of each of your top 2 , i'll need 1 and 3 , with the tie break being 1 remaining of least desireable to make it fair <eos> YOU: i think we can make that work . if you agree , let's submit the deal . i need to go to the doctor soon to get a boil lanced . <eos> THEM: ok , sounds good . feel free to submit it <eos> YOU: <selection>THEM: reject - deal <eos>  </dialogue> <output> item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> THEM: i am looking forward to this camping trip but i am concerned with not having enough water . <eos> YOU: oh , i can understand , i'm worried about food . <eos> THEM: i could agree to let you have more food in exchange for me having more water . <eos> YOU: that sounds like a fair plan . i wish they had consulted us before sending everyone the same basic package , don't you ? <eos> THEM: that would have been really helpful . as far as the firewood , i could use more of that also . i tend to get cold easily . <eos> YOU: i'm flexible on that , though i made the mistake of bringing a summer sleeping back to the mountains . a bit chilly , lol . <eos> THEM: so how does 2 waters for me and 1 for you , 2 firewoods for me and 1 for you , and 2 foods for you and 1 for me sound ? <eos> YOU: hmm , if you get 2 firewoods , then i'll need all 3 foods as i'll have to search around for extra wood . plus i was hoping to give some treats to my dog and they didn't include any in the supplies ! <eos> THEM: i realize with the odd number of extra supplies , there is no way to distribute equally . i can't give up any extra food incase of emergency . sorry . <eos> YOU: then i'll definitely need 2 food , 2 firewood , and just one water . <eos> THEM: i really need the extra water as i get dehydrated easily and i told you already about being cold . i'm not trying to be disagreeable . these are things i really have to have . <eos> YOU: i understand , but it is the same here . if dehydration is your biggest worry i can do 3 foods for me , and all three waters for you , with 2 wood for me . <eos> THEM: i can't let extra food go . i'm going to have to have 2 waters , 2 firewoods and 1 food . this is where i'm at . <eos> YOU: oh , dear , i'm afraid this might be a failed trip then . i really can't agree to that . too bad . <eos> THEM: sorry to hear that . we were so close . <eos> YOU: yeah , too bad you caught me on a bad week - i got cheated out of a work bonus on monday and now i'm not feeling very friendly / amenable . bad luck for both of us , sorry ! <eos>  </dialogue> <output> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> <disagree> </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 9 3 3 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , how are you doing ? <eos> THEM: not too good . i was robbed earlier before my camping trip with my boy . i need more items so i can take him on a camping trip that i've promised him for almost 6 months now . <eos> YOU: oh that is a shame . i am currently training for a marathon in greenland and i am trying to maintain my weight during this trip . what did they steal from you ? <eos> THEM: well after leaving the grocery , i put my groceries in my car and then got into the driver's seat . when i sat down , a man pointed his gun at me and told me to put my wallet in the center console and then get out the car . he took my car , wallet and all of my groceries . there were 3 packages of water , 3 bundles of firewood and 3 packages of food . <eos> YOU: i hope they catch that guy , well since you are close to our campsite we could cook something together . my husband brought his bow and fishing rod so i think we plan on getting some more food that way . <eos> THEM: that would be really nice of you , but my son is grown . he has a hearty appetite . i really need to feed him his snacks because he is austic and throws tantrums if he doesn't eat particular foods . same goes with water . <eos> YOU: i understand , our nephew has autism as well but not much of an appetite . we could also let you borrow the fishing rod and go out with your son for some bonding time . if you catch a fish or two that could help the trade on how much food i would be willing to give up . i am horribly afraid of darkness , so i would like more than enough firewood . <eos> THEM: if you could provide us with the food , it would be greatly appreciated . i recently lost my job so i was trying to take my boy on a trip to also get my mind off of things . i won't eat throughout the week if you can provide 2 fish ; however , if you did have a spare and could make it three , that would be greatly appreciated . one thing about the robbery that makes me really upset is that this guy took our firewood . i walked home after calling the police and was able to stop by a local park . there was some sticks i gathered to bring with us , but it won't last . any chance you can spare a few bundles ? <eos> YOU: hmmm , we picked up the firewood when we arrived the campsite because the park rangers do not want people bringing invasive pests to the area . i am horribly terrified of the dark and we are taking this trip for my husbands birthday . if it gets too dark i will not be able to sleep and it will not be good for my mental preparation for my marathon i have at the end of the month . i would really prefer to hand out more food than firewood since my husband is an amazing fisherman and i also enjoy eating squirrel . <eos> THEM: well how about this , i won't bother you about the firewood . i know it is something that seems beneficial to your well being . i can totally relate to that . for me , i would honestly rather any food you can spare , but my concern is water . it being the summer and a drought now , i don't think we'll make it through the weekend without any water . i can't afford any . do you think you can possibly provide us with 3 fish and 3 packages of water ? <eos> YOU: ok , i can give you two packages of food and two waters , we should be okay boiling our water . since my husband will be hunting for the extra food we will clean it and cook it , so can you give 2 packages of firewood ? <eos> THEM: i have no firewood . i have nothing ! i was robbed . if you want 1 package of firewood , i can give you 1 . however , i am going to need more food and water . i have sjorgren's syndrome . it causes me to dry out . my eyes , throat and really my full body gets dried up . its caused me to convulse in the past and have seizures . if something happens to me when i'm out in the words . who will take care of my boy ? i need to make sure i don't have an accident out there or they may take my son away from me . <eos> YOU: well we will be nearby . camping sounds a little dangerous with your condition . i suggest since you have no supplies to really offer that you stay next to our camp and share our fire . the ranger will give you the firewood upon arrival , if you give up the all 3 packages of firewood i will provide 2 food and 2 waters . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=3 item2=1 item0=2 item1=0 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </partner_input>

<input> 3 6 3 3 3 9 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello . i'm going to do a lot of hiking on my camping trip and need as much water as possible . i'm also planning a bonfire with fellow campers in the area , so i'd like as much firewood as possible . how about i keep the water and firewood and you keep the food ? <eos> THEM: that doesn't work for me . i will also need extra water because i drink a lot . how about we start by saying you get the firewood , and i'll take the food ? <eos> YOU: ok , but how do we split up the water ? because it sounds like we both need some . what if you take all the food and i take all the firewood and then i get two waters and you get one extra ? <eos> THEM: i would prefer to have 2 waters since i agreed to give you all the firewood . <eos> YOU: but i agreed to give you all the food . now that you want two waters , i think i should have some food because i left a bag of my food at home . you get two waters and i get one of the food . then you get the majority of both the water and food . <eos> THEM: so i get 2 waters / 2 food / 0 firewood , and you get 1 water / 1 food / 3 firewood ? i think that works for me . <eos> YOU: yes , that's the plan . by the way , what do you need all that food for ? you didn't say . i'm just curious . <eos> THEM: i'm a bigger guy ( 6'3 " ) so i eat a lot , especially after activities like hiking and kayaking . same reason i want water really . <eos> YOU: ok , that makes sense . i don't eat as much as you do , so it's only fair that you get most of the food . so i hope this deal will be fair for both of us and you'll walk away happy . <eos> THEM: yep , i'm happy , hope you are too ! i think we can enter the deal now . <eos> YOU: yes , i am . i'm entering the deal now . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=3 item1=1 item2=1 item0=0 item1=2 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 6 3 9 </partner_input>
