<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> YOU: hello , i am a lifelong camper . my favorite part of camping is sitting by the fire at night . i propose 3 packages of firewood for me , 1 water and 1 food . <eos> THEM: camping's definitely something i enjoy a lot too , but i also love to cook and would want at least a little wood to make a nice meal . i'd also like to go hiking at least once while i'm out . what about 3 food , one wood , and one water for myself ? <eos> YOU: well i need at least 1 food for myself . i'm very active , too . i love to hike and i imagine i would be very hungry . i need to replenish those calories . <eos> THEM: well remember that we both have enough food already for our trip , so this would just be some extra . would it make you feel any better if i brought you some of the food i made ? <eos> YOU: in the era of social distancing , i would rather cook my own food , but that was very nice of you to offer . <eos> THEM: yeah , i definitely know what you mean there . it sounds like you're more active than me so i think we can definitely agree on you getting two of the water and me just getting one for now <eos> YOU: okay let's agree to me getting 2 water and you getting 1 water . as for the firewood , it is really important to me to get 3 . camping is my life . my parents took us camping all throughout my childhood . we loved sitting around the fire together at night and having a good time . my parents have since passed on and i really need the extra firewood to keep this tradition and memories alive . <eos> THEM: sorry for your loss . i can respect wanting to keep them in your thoughts with a roaring bonfire or three while you're out , but are you going alone ? i'm going with a group of four so there's going to be at least someone there that will also want a bigger fire one night even if i don't . <eos> YOU: i will have 3 people with me . my son , my sister and her daughter . so okay , how about i take 2 firewood , 2 water and 1 food ? <eos> THEM: i think that's pretty agreeable for covering our bases ; though if your kids are young i could see you not needing two extra containers of water since you're probably not going on any short hikes . the food and fire seems respectful to both of our needs <eos> YOU: my son is 15 and my niece is 13 . they are athletes . we will be doing hiking and biking . we will be needing the extra water . <eos> THEM: alright then ; we were focusing more on canoeing with a bit of hiking on the side so i suppose i'll cede you the extra water . if it sounds good to you i'll submit my deal of 2 food , 1 water , 1 firewood now . <eos> YOU: ok i think that is fair <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=1 item2=2 item0=1 item1=2 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 3 3 9 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hello i was thinking that i could get 3 firwoods ? what are your thoughts ? <eos> YOU: hello , i was thinking you are crazy . i would also like firewood as i am naturally a very cold person so i need as much warmth as possible . i live in the heat and i still use a heavy blanket to stay warm . my termperature range is very small as i also sweat alot so i'll need lots of water as well . how about you ? <eos> THEM: okay what if you let me get 2 firewoods . i need a little more because where we are going its gets very cold . i will give you 2 waters if i could get 2 firewoods . <eos> YOU: i think i could survive on 1 firewood , but i would need all the waters and a little extra food . when i drink water , i always need something extra to go with it . how does 1 firewood , 3 water , and 1 food for me sound to you ? <eos> THEM: okay i can understand that what if i gave you 2 foods and i get at least 1 water ? <eos> YOU: that sounds reasonable - i can take 1 firewood , 2 waters , and 2 food . that will at least keep me somewhat warm and hydrated . i'll just have to remember to pack more firewood . . <eos> THEM: great ! i just have to make sure i use my water wisely <eos> YOU: agreed . i think there's a creek in the area so maybe bring some water purifiers that will make the water potable . you can also use the firewood to heat up the water . <eos> THEM: oh yea that a great idea , so you get 1 firewood and i get two and you get 2 waters and i get 1 and you get 2 foods and i get 1 correct ? <eos> YOU: that's correct - sounds like we'll both have a fun trip ahead of us . <eos> THEM: yes can't wait . so we have a deal ! ? <eos> YOU: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=2 item2=2 item0=2 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </partner_input>

<input> 3 9 3 3 3 6 </input> <dialogue> THEM: hi there . i'm hoping we can make a deal about me getting firewood . i get really cold at night and i'd love to have my fire still going in the morning for coffee - i'd gladly share some if you pop by my campsite . <eos> YOU: i am in dire need of firewood myself . i was planning on bringing food that needed to be cooked over flame . <eos> THEM: well maybe we can find a way to split it ! this isn't a problem we can't solve . are you in need of food too , then ? <eos> YOU: that would be great ! i don't need food as much as i am in need of firewood , to be honest . <eos> THEM: i brought purification tablets so i can make do with rainwater or river water . how about you ? <eos> YOU: that's very smart ! way to be prepared ! i didn't think to do that . <eos> THEM: so if we were to split the firewood more in your favor and i were to take all the food , and then we kind of split the water , i think we could maybe make a deal here ? <eos> YOU: i think that is definitely doable ! i'd be glad to make a deal with you . thanks for being so reasonable ! <eos> THEM: so i'm proposing 1 firewood to me , 2 to you . 3 food to me . and 2 water to me , 1 to you . can we work with that ? firewood seems to be important to the both of us so i'm giving up things here . <eos> YOU: yes i think that will work just fine . firewood is important especially because i usually find my food in the woods . <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=2 item1=0 item2=1 item0=1 item1=3 item2=2 </output> <partner_input> 3 9 3 6 3 3 </partner_input>
